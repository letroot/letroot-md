# Jack Canfield — Selling 600+ Million Books, Success Principles, and How He Made the 4-Hour Workweek Happen

## Summary
Jack Canfield (author of *Chicken Soup for the Soul*) shares timeless principles for extreme ownership and goal achievement. He discusses the "100% responsibility" mindset, the power of affirmations, the "Rule of 5" for marketing, and the importance of clearing mental and physical "messes" to unlock focus.

## Key Insights
*   **100% Responsibility**: If you take full responsibility, you forfeit the right to complain, blame, or make excuses. Either change the situation or accept it; complaining is just spinning your tires.
*   **The TV Audit**: Cutting TV from 3 hours to 1 hour/day reclaims ~730 hours/year (4.3 work weeks). Reinvest that time into your goals.
*   **Affirmations & Visualization**: "God is my answer and supply, large sums of money come easily and quickly as I make +$100k a year." Believe it, visualize it, and say it every time you walk through a door (trigger habit).
*   **The Rule of 5**: Do 5 specific things *every single day* to move your main goal forward. Consistency compounds aggressively over 5 years.
*   **Prayer & Contemplation**: Use meditative contemplation to "download" ideas and solutions.
*   **Clean Up Your Messes**: Incomplete tasks (financial, domestic, relational) drain your attention. Clean them up to free mental RAM for focus.
*   **66 Days to Change**: Give yourself 66 days to rewire mental habits and self-belief systems.

## Coach's Corner
As a founder, your mindset is the bottleneck.
1.  **Stop complaining about bugs/churn.** Fix them. You built this; own the problems fully.
2.  **Marketing Discipline.** The "Rule of 5" is brutal but effective. Send 5 emails, make 5 calls, fix 5 SEO issues. Daily.
3.  **Clear the cruft.** That unfinished feature branch, that ignored email thread—it's draining you. Close it or finish it.

## Action Items
*   [ ] **Adopt the Rule of 5**: Write down 5 specific actions you will take *tomorrow* to grow your SaaS. Do this every night.
*   [ ] **Clean Up One Mess**: Pick one lingering "incomplete" task (e.g., taxes, a broken link, an apology) and resolve it today.
*   [ ] **Create Your Affirmation**: Write a specific financial/business goal affirmation. Post it on your door.
*   [ ] **Audit Your Time**: Track your "TV time" (or YouTube/Twitter time) for one day. Reclaim at least 1 hour.
