# AI Changes Nothing (at OpenCode)

## Summary
Dax Raad argues that despite the AI hype, the fundamental principles of building successful software remain unchanged. Marketing must still arrest attention, and product design must still relentlessly drive users to their "aha moment" with zero friction.

## Key Insights
*   **Arrest [[Attention]]**: Marketing isn't just about information; it's about stopping the scroll. You must compel people to spread the word.
*   **The "[[Aha Moment]]" Sprint**: Your primary product goal is to get users to the "aha moment" as fast as possible.
*   **[[Friction]] Removal**: Ruthlessly cut away every step that exists before the value realization. If it doesn't help them "get it," it's in the way.
*   **Start from the Core**: Build your primitives around the core feature that works for 99% of users. Don't overcomplicate the base layer with edge cases; funnel users from the simple core to advanced features later.

## Coach's Corner
You're building a SaaS. Don't let the tech stack distract you from the user journey.
1.  **Audit your onboarding.** How many clicks until I see value? If it's more than 3, cut it down.
2.  **Focus on the 99%.** Stop building for the power user before you've satisfied the new user.
3.  **Marketing is a feature.** If your product is great but boring, you lose.

## Action Items
*   [ ] **Define Your Aha Moment**: Write down exactly what the "aha moment" is for your app.
*   [ ] **The "One-Click" Audit**: Go through your signup flow. Remove one entire screen or step this week.
*   [ ] **Simplify the Core**: Look at your main feature. Is it composing simple primitives, or is it a monolith of edge cases? Refactor for composition.
