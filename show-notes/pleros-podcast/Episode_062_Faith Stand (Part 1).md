# Faith Stand (Part 1)

Welcome to Plaro's podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Welcome back to the Blur Rose podcast. We are here to give you your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. As we can see from what the intent of the podcast is about, we are primarily focused on what God's focus himself is, which is his purpose. We started looking at the place of the gospel in our lives, which is the fact that the gospel is the truth.

## The Foundation of God’s Purpose and Sonship

The gospel reveals what God's purpose is, which we studied and found is sunship. We explored and understood what sunship is, particularly from Paul's explanation in Romans chapter 8:15-17. Sunship is the reality of being God's child as well as his heirs. As God's child, we are called to fellowship with him, walk with him in his nature and character, and perform the assignments he has allotted to us as his heirs. 

Knowing God's purpose is not enough; there must be more to it than intellectual knowledge. We must understand how we fulfill that purpose through what I call the road map of purpose. This journey involves functioning as a child through the regular maintenance of a devotional life and functioning as both natural and spiritual heirs. It is one thing to know the direction or the path to take, but another thing entirely to be able to bear the burden as we carry out his purpose for our lives.

## Understanding Growth and the Inward Man

Growth happens on the mind of man, and this is important for a person to recognize when they are in God's purpose. You only come into God's purpose by receiving the spirit of sunship, as seen in Romans 8:15. Having the spirit means one part of the equation is solved, and we are entirely brand new with the nature and life of God. However, that doesn't account for what growth means for the believer. Growth does not happen in our spirit, which is already in a complete and divine state, but rather on our mind. 

Spiritual growth is the increase of the influence of our spirit on our mind as opposed to the influence of the flesh or the world. To understand this, we must have an appreciation of man in his entirety. 1 Thessalonians 5:23 shows us that man is spirit, soul, and body, while 2 Corinthians 4:16 describes man as an inward and outward man. The outward man is perishing while the inward man is being renewed day by day. Paul calls the outward man a tent, a building, or a cloth, while the inward man is the real man.

The Lord Jesus taught this reality in Luke 16 through the account of Lazarus and the rich man. When their outward bodies died and were buried, their inward man continued to exist with memory, reasoning, and initiative. This shows that the inward man is the spirit with the mind, while the outward man is the body with a brain. Just as the brain is the controlling center of our physical body, the mind is the controlling center of our spiritual person. 

## The Seven Aspects of the Human Mind

Because growth happens on the mind, we need to know which aspect of the mind is the determinant of our conduct. There are seven aspects of the mind to consider. Number one is reasoning, where you think about what is being said. The second aspect is memory, where information is stored long-term or short-term. The third aspect is the will, which allows us to take initiative and choose to agree or disagree with what is put before us.

If we agree with information, it becomes our conviction, which is the fourth aspect. It is one thing for something to be a conviction, and another for that conviction to become our consciousness or reckoning. This fifth aspect is what we present and stand on, which is vital for the "faith stand." The final two aspects are our emotions, which are products of our state of reckoning, and our conscience judgments, which are our reactive judgments of right and wrong.

Conscience has three things at play: the preceding consciousness, the perception at the moment, and the final judgment. The preceding consciousness is the state of your reckoning prior to a situation. At the moment of contact, there is a dual perception involving both your natural senses and your mind perceiving together with them. This "co-perception" causes you to react and pass a judgment of good, bad, or evil.

## Renewing the Spirit of the Mind

The work of the church seeks to address this consciousness and transform our minds. It is not just about giving us knowledge, but about refreshing the truth so that we are transformed to walk as we should. Ephesians 4:17 warns that we should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles do. This implies that it is possible to be a believer yet still have the same worldly reasoning, reckoning, and consciousness on your mind. 

Ephesians 4:20-24 tells us to put off the old man and be renewed in the spirit of our mind to put on the new man. This putting off and putting on affects our consciousness and has to do with how we stand. In the next episode, we are going to see exactly where faith ties into this activity that transforms us. For now, thank you, and I will see you on the next one.
