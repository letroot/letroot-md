# The Pursuit of God's Purpose (Part 11)

Our current study explores the pursuit of God's purpose, specifically focusing on our spiritual assignment. As previously established, God's purpose for us is "sonship," meaning we are both children of God and heirs of God. As children of God, we fellowship with Him and embody His nature and character. As heirs of God, we have both a natural and a spiritual assignment.

We have already explored our natural assignment. This involves starting from our current position, seizing opportunities as they arise, pursuing our desires in this world, remaining open to the Spirit's leading, and striving for maximal productivity. These are core tenets of our natural calling.

However, our primary focus has been on our spiritual assignment, which is often the most overlooked and neglected aspect of God's purpose. Regrettably, even our natural assignment can be neglected when individuals fail to recognize it as God-given, instead pursuing their own paths and desires as if they were their own gods. This concern applies to both aspects of our purpose. Yet, if we must prioritize neglect, it is undoubtedly our spiritual assignment that suffers the greatest oversight.

It is important to address the lack of commitment to spiritual assignments, not to condemn, but to understand the underlying reasons. By examining this through God's Word, we can illuminate hearts and provide guidance on how to fulfill our divine responsibilities. The intention here is not to criticize but to encourage a deeper engagement with God's perspective on this crucial area.

## Understanding Commitment to Spiritual Assignments

Some people believe it is unrealistic to commit to a spiritual assignment given the demands of their daily lives. They genuinely feel they love the Lord and can walk with Him without the "extra" commitment, thinking they can simply offer prayer as support for the work while focusing on their natural responsibilities.

This option, however, exists only for a select few whose natural assignments inherently make them unavailable to participate directly. For instance, certain security personnel or individuals involved in movement and transportation may, due to their work schedules, find it challenging to consistently partake in spiritual assignments. Even for these individuals, arrangements are often made for their involvement. While some in security roles may experience greater periods of exclusion, a heart aligned with the work will discern what to do and when. This understanding is what we aim to establish as we discuss spiritual assignment in this chapter.

We have firmly established from God's Word that each of us has a "lot" of ministry. Acts 1 uses this word "lot" alongside "part," which describes our place in the Body of Christ and in ministry (1 Corinthians 12:27, Romans 12, Ephesians 4:7-16). Therefore, you have a specific lot and a part in the work of ministry given to you by the Lord. What does this mean, and how do you begin to fulfill it?

## The Role of Church Discipleship

One clear principle we have emphasized is that your spiritual assignment should be born out of the discipleship of the church. In fact, treating your natural work as God's assignment to you is also a concept born out of the church's leadership. Without this framework, you risk falling into what the Bible calls covetousness, which Ephesians 5:5 and Colossians identify as idolatry—a focus on self. If you approach your work solely from a self-centered standpoint, it becomes idolatry.

This is not to say that you shouldn't enjoy things in the world; that is not a biblical position. First Timothy 6, which we have referenced regarding our natural assignment, speaks to this. It instructs those who are rich not to be high-minded, but to give and commit their resources to the work of the Lord.

Let us read 1 Timothy 6:17-18: "Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy." The "all things" here are given by God, with the only exception being the contradictions found in the world. Whether we speak of God-given spiritual blessings or natural provisions, they all come from God. The Bible does not oppose the use of worldly things or pleasure; it opposes ungodly pleasure and champions godly pleasure.

The Bible teaches us to allocate our resources across needs, wants, and God's mission on earth. Through divine wisdom, we must apportion resources for the mission, for our needs, and for our legitimate wants and enjoyment. This is our right and nobody's business, but we must, through the discipleship of the church, treat both our natural and spiritual work as God's assignment to us.

## The Necessity of Local Church Affiliation

The first step in fulfilling your spiritual assignment is commitment to discipleship within the local church. Regardless of your situation, once you are saved, you need to find a local church you align with and begin to grow there.

We live in an interesting time, quite different from the age of the apostles. During the apostolic age, there was a higher tendency for uniformity. The apostles were directly responsible for doctrine, making it easier to reference their words and presence for resolution of disagreements. After this period, tendencies like denominationalism emerged. We must discern what is foundational—what must be present for a gathering to truly be a church—and what is secondary, though still very important, which could be a deal-breaker.

Foundational elements include truths essential for salvation. Beyond that, there are important considerations regarding exploitation. Peter and Jude warned against those who exploit others, whether financially, sexually, or simply by exploiting their time and energy. You must be wary of such individuals, as these practices will hinder your walk with God.

## Committing to Growth and Service

Once you find a church where there is a reasonable level of agreement for your growth and work, you should commit. You are better off committing to a local body than not. While exploitation or doctrinal error can be costly, and God's Word grants you wisdom to avoid them, in other cases, when you find a place you align with, even if you are not yet certain of every truth, that is acceptable; you are growing. If, by divine orchestration, you later gain greater understanding, the wisdom of God's Word guides you to be faithful with what you know and continue to grow. You can navigate such situations appropriately.

However, you are not better served by not being in a local church. It provides an environment that continuously stirs your heart towards worship, helps you regard God's call on your life, and encourages you to treat your work and assignments as intended. It is easy to deviate and act in an idolatrous manner, even as people of God with His Spirit within us. You need the local church. It is not something to take lightly.

What does the local church do for you? As it disciples you, it tells you to "go"—precisely what the Lord Jesus commanded. From the moment you are plugged into a local church, you are instructed to go.

Consider the example of Paul. This is the first step: you can go with what you have. Being plugged into a local church is vital because as you go, you will have questions, and the leadership, being better equipped and having more insight, can guide you.

## Paul's Example of Immediate Service

Acts chapter 9 recounts Paul's experience immediately after his encounter and salvation. Reading from verse 19: "So when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then Saul spent some days with the disciples at Damascus. Immediately he preached Christ in the synagogues."

Observe the sequence: after his encounter, he fasted for three days, Ananias ministered to him, and then Saul spent "some days with the disciples at Damascus." He was immediately plugged in with the disciples. The very next sentence states, "Immediately he preached."

The idea that you begin ministry by isolating yourself in a room, praying for a grand encounter or specific call, is mistaken. As we discussed concerning natural assignments, you do not hunt for such a moment; it will come when it is time. Instead, you already have the wisdom of God's Word to guide your actions. You start with discipleship. You get plugged into a local church, you begin discipleship, and simultaneously, you "go."

Paul's actions illustrate this perfectly. He was learning and "going" at the same time. At this early stage, he would not have functioned as a leader; he had just been saved. However, he was already involved in the work, serving zealously as a faithful church member. His zeal would accelerate his journey to leadership, which, according to Ephesians 4, is the norm and God's design for every believer. There is a process to this, which we continue to explore in the pursuit of God's purpose regarding our spiritual assignment.

The key points are clear: First, commit to discipleship. This is how you begin your spiritual assignment. Second, simultaneously "go" from where you are. Paul went immediately from Damascus. This means doing whatever you can, where you are. In the next episode, we will further unpack what "go" implies for our age and time, and the implications of Jesus' words for today.
