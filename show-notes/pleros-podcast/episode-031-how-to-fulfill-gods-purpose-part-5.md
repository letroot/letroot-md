# How to Fulfill God's Purpose (Part 5)

We continue our studies on fulfilling God's purpose, now focusing on the transformative process required for that fulfillment. We have established what God's purpose is through His direct revelation.

Purpose, by its very nature, must be revealed; it cannot be known through observation or human reason alone. While personal words from God are vital for our individual walk, the primary and foundational way to understand His purpose is through His direct and general revelation to humanity—the Bible. This sacred document is authorized by the resurrection of Jesus as the ultimate truth.

From the Bible, we clearly and directly discern God's purpose. Ephesians 1 is particularly explicit, stating in verse nine that He has "made known unto us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure." Ephesians 1:5 further clarifies that His good pleasure and will is what He predestined us to: sonship. As we have studied from Romans 8:15-17, sonship means being both God's child and God's heir.

## Embracing Our Divine Inheritance

We will zoom in on the "heir" aspect of this equation. While being God's child is foundational, it does not always immediately convey a sense of fulfillment or accomplishment. The scriptures recognize the expectation for individuals to fulfill what they are meant to do. This is evident in Paul’s writing, particularly in 2 Timothy 4:6-8, where he declares he has "fought the good fight" and "finished the race." He also instructed Timothy to "fulfill your ministry," setting an example of someone who completed their divine assignment.

We can understand inheritance on three distinct levels: the indwelling of God's Spirit, the entirety of creation as joint-heirs with Christ, and our individual assignments. It is this third level—our individual assignments—where we focus on fulfilling God's purpose for our lives. Awareness of these assignments, both natural and spiritual, is crucial.

A common challenge arises from pre-salvation conditioning, which often leads to personal preferences that conflict with spiritual assignments. As believers, it is crucial to maintain balance in our understanding of God's purpose. The Spirit of God within us empowers us to accomplish all that God has called us to do.

## God's Work Within Us

Philippians 2:13 states that God is at work in us, "both to will and to do of His good pleasure." This signifies God's active work within us, both in willing and doing our natural and spiritual assignments. As believers, we cannot claim a lack of desire, for our new nature aligns us with God's will. When confronted with contradictory feelings, we must affirm God's word and the reality of our new identity.

To fulfill our assignments, we must cultivate a life of devotion and continuous growth. Our devotional life strengthens us to carry the weight of our assignments. The very first step towards accomplishing God's calling is attaining the spiritual stature that makes it possible. We should possess a dual ambition: to grow spiritually and, subsequently, to fulfill God's purpose for our lives.

In Ephesians 4, Paul outlines the discipleship mandate given to the church. The Lord provided church leaders—apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastor-teachers—for the perfecting of the saints. As these leaders perfect the saints, the saints then undertake the work of ministry and edify the body of Christ. The Greek word for "perfecting" is *katartismos*, meaning to bring to an end point or a specific destination. This destination includes attaining "the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God."

## The Transformation of the Mind

We are to be brought to an end point in knowledge, as well as an end point in stature and spiritual maturity. In Ephesians 4:17, Paul explains the result of this work: "that we should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk." Their walk is a product of the futility and emptiness of their minds. Their understanding is darkened because they are alienated from the life of God through ignorance and the blindness of their hearts.

Paul demonstrates that our walk should change once we have believed the gospel, because the church's ministry is designed to address and transform our minds. If the church effectively addresses our minds, our actions and lifestyle are expected to follow suit. The growth we need is a transformation that primarily occurs in our minds, rather than solely in our spirits. This transformation impacts every aspect of our lives, empowering us to carry out our divine assignments.
