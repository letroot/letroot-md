# The Reality of God's Purpose (Part 7)

By now, you should know that God's purpose is sonship. In this episode, we will make substantial progress in understanding this reality.

## The Foundation of Sonship and Purpose

God's purpose is sonship, as described in Ephesians 1:5 and 1:9. To understand this concept, Romans 8:15-17 is particularly insightful. Paul explains that we receive the spirit of sonship, which enables us to cry, "Abba, Father." This reality means we are children of God, and consequently, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.

Sonship encompasses two primary realities: being children of God and being heirs of God. It is crucial to remember that purpose is discovered through revelation. Objective revelation, derived directly from the Bible, must be prioritized over subjective personal revelation. For further explanation, the Pleros Perfecting Course at pleros.org offers detailed insights.

As children of God, our calling is to fellowship with our Father and embody His nature and character. However, the aspect of sonship that most directly relates to the human drive for purpose is our status as heirs of God. This intrinsic sense of pursuit is universally recognized; all humans ponder their existence and what they are meant to accomplish.

A profound sense of fulfillment and achievement is intrinsic to every human being. Throughout Scripture, God's design for us to *do* something is evident. In Genesis 1:26, He instructs humanity to "have dominion," clearly indicating an assignment. While the specific interpretation of this command varies for each individual, an undeniable blueprint exists for us to pursue and achieve a divine goal.

This inherent drive was also present in Jesus Christ, who declared that His sustenance was to do the will of the One who sent Him and to finish His work. Paul echoed this sentiment, and both Jesus and Paul could ultimately affirm that they had completed their respective tasks, as seen in John 17:4 and 2 Timothy 4:7. This sense of objective completion is arguably the most satisfying feeling one can experience. It stands in stark contrast to the contemplation often observed in elderly individuals at life's crossroads, who may question the significance of their accomplishments. The end of life is not the time for such self-reflection; it should be a moment of declaring, "I have finished."

## The Divine Mandate of Natural Work

With the understanding that God's purpose is rooted in sonship and the gospel's truth, we recognize a firm foundation for purpose. As an heir, specific assignments are allotted to you. Colossians 3:22 through 4:1 reveals that our natural work—our career, employment, or academic pursuits—is an integral part of this divine allocation. Whether you are a student, an employee, or a freelancer, these roles are given to you by the Lord.

Your natural work is not merely a personal choice; it is a divine assignment. Colossians 3:24 affirms that from the Lord, you will "receive the reward of the inheritance." This natural assignment is a category of inheritance God bestows upon everyone. It is crucial to grasp that even individuals not yet born again are, in a sense, engaged in what would typically be God's assignment for them, though they lack the redeemed heart and spirit necessary to fulfill it truly.

Because your work is a divine allotment, it demands absolute faithfulness. You are ultimately serving the Lord Christ, not just your earthly employer. It is concerning to observe believers exhibiting poor attitudes at work simply because their boss is difficult. Both Paul and Peter acknowledged the reality of challenging masters, yet they consistently urged for excellence in service.

While individuals have the right to seek a better work environment if conditions are genuinely toxic, productivity and faithfulness are imperative while in a given role. There is no justification for laziness or indifference, as your work contributes to God's world and serves as a testimony of righteousness and light. Ephesians 6:5 instructs us to be obedient to masters "with sincerity of heart, as unto Christ." We are called to avoid mere "eye service"—working only to please people—and instead, act as bondservants of Christ, fulfilling God's will. This entails approaching your work with the same honor and dedication you would offer directly to Christ. Regardless of whether you are an employee or an employer, these principles apply universally, for your ultimate Master resides in heaven, and He shows no partiality concerning your natural labor.

## The Eternal Significance of Everyday Labor

The work you undertake in the natural realm is an integral part of God's purpose for your life, and it carries eternal significance. You will either be rewarded or experience loss of rewards based on your faithfulness in these assignments. It is a misconception to believe that natural work is less important than "spiritual" assignments. While spiritual endeavors certainly have direct eternal implications, your conduct in your natural work equally impacts your eternal state.

Therefore, it is essential to respect your natural assignment as a vital component of God's design for you. A key scripture in this regard is 1 Corinthians 7:17, which states, "But as God has distributed to each one, as God has called each one, so let him walk." This passage underscores God's active role in distributing these specific roles and callings to each individual, a topic we will explore in greater detail in the next session.
