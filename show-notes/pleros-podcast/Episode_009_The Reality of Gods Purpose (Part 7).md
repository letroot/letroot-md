# The Reality of God's Purpose (Part 7)

Welcome to the Pleros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Welcome to the Pleros podcast yet again, your daily dose of God's word for transformation. I trust it is helping you fulfill God's purpose. By now, you should know that God's purpose is sonship. In this episode, we are going to ensure that we make some massive progress in that regard.

## The Definition and Revelation of Sonship

We have seen God's purpose described as sonship in Ephesians 1:5 and 1:9. One of the best places to explain what this means is Romans 8:15-17. Paul says we receive the spirit of sonship whereby we cry, "Abba, Father." He points out that the reality of that spirit is that we are children of God, and on that premise, we are heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.

Two realities make up sonship: first, we are children of God, and second, we are heirs of God. Remember that purpose can only be found by revelation. You must prize objective revelation, which is the direct word of God found in the Bible, over and above subjective personal revelation. You can find more explanation on this at pleros.org, particularly in the Pleros Perfecting Course.

As children of God, we are meant to fellowship with our Father and walk in His nature and character. However, the part of the equation that really has to do with pursuit is the fact that we are heirs of God. There is no doubt that all humans recognize this sense of pursuit within themselves. We all find ourselves asking why we are here and what we are supposed to get done.

## The Human Wiring for Fulfillment

There is a sense of fulfillment and achievement wired into everyone. Running across scripture is this design by God for us to do something. In Genesis 1:26, He says to "have dominion," showing there is clearly something to do. While this requires interpretation to know how it plays out for you, there is an undeniable design for us to pursue and fulfill a divine goal.

We saw this same drive in the Lord Jesus, who said His meat was to do the will of Him who sent Him and to finish it. Paul spoke similarly, and we are fortunate that both Jesus and Paul could eventually say they had finished their work. This is reflected in John 17:4 and 2 Timothy 4:7. Truly, that is the greatest feeling one can ever have.

I don't think there is anything more satisfying than the sense of objective completion. You can see this when talking to elderly people who are at a crossroads in life. They often wonder if what they did really mattered and if they did what they should have done. The end of life is the wrong time to ask that question; that is when you should be saying, "I have finished."

## Natural Work as a Divine Inheritance

Thankfully, you recognize what God's purpose is on the grounds we have stated. Remember that we started with the place of the gospel in your life, which is the truth. If you don't have that foundation, you will be on shaky grounds regarding the revelation of purpose. You have seen that you are an heir, which means specific things are assigned to you.

We see in Colossians 3:22 through 4:1 that our natural work—our career or employment—is part of this. Whether you are a student in the academic space or functioning as a freelancer, these roles are allotted to you by the Lord. Whatever your natural work is, it is given to you by God. Colossians 3:24 notes that from the Lord you receive the reward of the inheritance.

The natural assignment is a class of inheritance the Lord gives to everyone. It is very important to recognize that what you are doing in the natural is not just your own idea. Even if someone is not yet born again, they are still doing what would ordinarily have been God's assignment to them. However, they are unable to do it with the right heart and spirit without redemption.

## Service with Sincerity of Heart

Because your work is God’s allotment to you, it calls for absolute faithfulness. You are serving the Lord Christ, not just your boss. It is grieving to see believers with poor attitudes at work just because their boss is difficult. Paul and Peter were aware of difficult masters, yet they still commanded excellence in service.

While you have the right to choose a better work environment if conditions are toxic, you must be productive and faithful while you are there. You have no right to be lazy or indifferent because you are doing your part for God's world. This is a testimony of righteousness and light. Ephesians 6:5 tells us to be obedient to masters with sincerity of heart, as unto Christ.

We should not work with "eye service" just to please men, but as bondservants of Christ doing the will of God. This means regarding your work with the same honor you would give to Christ. Whether you are an employee or an employer, the rules are the same because your own Master is in heaven. There is no partiality with Him regarding your natural labor.

## The Eternal Weight of Natural Assignments

What you do in the natural is part of God's purpose for your life, and you will be judged for it. You are going to be rewarded or lose rewards based on your faithfulness in these assignments. The idea that natural work doesn't matter as much as "spiritual" assignments is a mistake. While spiritual work has direct eternal implications, your natural conduct also affects your eternal state.

Please respect your natural assignment as part of God's design for you. The last text we will look at is 1 Corinthians 7:17, which says, "But as God has distributed to each one, as God has called each one, so let him walk." This text is important because it shows how God distributes these roles. We will pick this up in more detail in the next session.
