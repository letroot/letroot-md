# The Reality of God's Purpose (Part 8)

Welcome to Plaros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Brothers and sisters, you are on the Pleros podcast, your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose for your life. Now, we've seen a lot about God's purpose of recent, so I trust you're keeping up with it. We've seen from Ephesians 1:9 and 5 that God's purpose is sonship. Romans 8:15-17 shows that sonship means we are children of God and heirs of God.

This means that God's purpose is us fellowshipping with him as children, as well as walking in his nature and character. On the other hand, God's purpose is us serving as heirs of God. We've explained that being heirs of God means all that he owns belongs to us as joint-heirs with Christ, which is all of creation. But it is well-rooted in God's word that there's a specific inheritance beyond the joint inheritance we have.

## The Individual Assignment and Natural Work

There's this severed inheritance where we have, as individuals, our own place in God's assignments and our own place in the grand scheme of God's purpose and plan. We have been looking at what assignment exactly we have. We've seen that we have a natural assignment, found in major texts like Colossians 3:22 through chapter 4 and verse one. We've also seen Ephesians 6:9, which shows there are certain assignments we have naturally. 

Whatever you find your hand to do in the natural, the Lord has given it to you. That is true of every believer. I do understand that there's the concept of full-time ministry today, which is born out of a genuine desire to sacrifice one's heart, focus, and attention away from the world for the Lord. It is extremely helpful if one is genuinely faithful to it, and there are people that do that. 

However, the rule rather than the exception is the reality that every believer and minister alike is to be involved in both their natural assignment and their spiritual assignment. Paul is an example that he showed of this rule. If you read 2 Thessalonians chapter 3, you see that Paul and his prodigies were like that. There were some who were an exception, but it clearly didn't seem to be the rule from God's word as far as the data we have is concerned.

## Understanding the Condition of Your Calling

We should be careful how hurriedly we rush into the conclusion of excluding ourselves from our natural assignment, even when you have very high responsibility in the work of ministry. 1 Corinthians 7 would be an additional text to help us appreciate what our place as heirs of God is. Verse 17 says: "But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk." That word "distributed" is a very interesting word that has to do with inheritance as well.

The word used is "merizo," which is the verb related to the noun "meros," meaning a part. We also saw the word "kleros," which refers to being an heir or having an inheritance. While "kleros" is a lot assigned to someone, "meros" is a part. You can see that the two words are related. When you have a lot given to you, it is usually a part of what the person owns that is given to you.

In this case, he said God has parted to each. This shows us there is a severed inheritance. There is a sense where you are joined with Christ, and together with him we own all of creation, but here he's saying God has parted to each one as he has called each one. He's talking about the state in which you were called, referring to the condition you were in at the point where you received the gospel.

## Avoiding the Trap of Compartmentalization

God calls us by the message of the gospel and we enter into the church, the "ecclesia," meaning people called out of darkness into his marvelous light. That condition in which you are called is where you enter into God's purpose. We have people that are saved but have zero idea they are saved unto God's purpose. They are just walking in the dark about God's will for their life. 

For many, salvation is just a compartment of their life and the gospel is a compartment. They have their own personal desires, and they can become almost idolatrous about what they are doing in the natural. It becomes all about them, their passion, their fulfillment, and their pride. They do not do what they do from the standpoint of submission to God's will, which isn't the way we should function. 

That's an idolatrous way of functioning, compartmentalizing and relegating God. At this point, you are also relegating God because he becomes one of the gods, not the God in your life. You must be careful how you separate your natural assignment from God because it is his assignment given to you. Paul says, "and so I ordained in all the churches." This is a general rule, not just an opinion.

## The Priority of the Spiritual Assignment

Paul shows that our natural standing—whether circumcised or uncircumcised, slave or free—does not affect our spiritual state. He says, "Let each one remain in the calling wherein he was called." If you were called while a slave, do not be concerned about it. He who is called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord's freedman; likewise, he who is called while free is Christ's slave. 

The Lord is well aware of whatever condition you are in at the instance you enter into his purpose. You don't need to change your status to be effectively in God's purpose. Your natural assignment begins from the state you had at the time you received salvation or became enlightened. The idea of our natural assignment being part and parcel of God's purpose is well established in scripture.

However, there is yet another assignment: our spiritual assignment. This spiritual assignment ought to be treated as a priority because of its implications. Imagine a man is so faithful in his natural work but has not received the gospel or grown to serve the Lord. All the efforts he makes in the natural go to waste. Therefore, to treat the spiritual assignment as anything short of the highest priority is to be ignorant of its worth.

## A Wholesome View of Ministry

By God's design, our natural assignment takes the bulk of our time, yet by value, the spiritual cannot be relegated. We are in a world that is going to come to an end, as Peter says. What manner of persons ought we to be in holy conduct? This means the spiritual must hold priority despite the fact that most people will dedicate more time to their natural assignments. It's not a sin; it's just the way working hours are designed.

I want to show you in scripture the evidence that we all have a spiritual assignment. Some say God just calls certain people to ministry, but is that really true? In Acts 1:17, when Judas needed a replacement, Peter said, "For he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry." The word "part" there is "kleros," a portion or a lot in the ministry. 

This shows there is a ministry with different portions. Judas had a lot in this ministry, but he messed it up. When it comes to ministry, which is a spiritual work, this idea of a lot and part is used. This extends to all believers. When we see your natural and spiritual assignments together, we have a complete view of what God's purpose for our life is. God's purpose is sonship; you are God's child and God's heir. Catch you on the next one. God bless you.
