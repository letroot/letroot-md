# The Mind of Man (Part 17)

We are examining the mind of man, and specifically today, the consciousness part of the mind. We will zoom in on this aspect, exploring what scripture says about it, using biblical texts to explain it clearly.

We began by referring to this part of our mind as the reckoning or presenting part. It is also the affirming part, distinct from the knowing part. What we know is what we then reckon and affirm. We use the word "consciousness" to lead into a particular word, "conscience," which aptly describes this reality.

## The Mind and the Path of Spiritual Growth

Our overarching theme is God's purpose: sonship. To fulfill this purpose and live daily according to God's will and glory, we must grow. This growth occurs in our mind, not in our spirit.

Our spirit represents our nature—fixed, permanent, unchanged, and unchanging. It is in a complete, perfect, and divine state, just as Christ and God are. We are one spirit with the Lord; God is in us, and we are in God. This is our true nature. Since the spirit cannot grow or develop, growth must take place in our mind.

How exactly does our mind operate? What are its various aspects? While we might conceptualize them as compartments, the mind is ultimately one entity. The scripture presents it as a singular mind, despite the different processes occurring within it.

## The Dynamics of the Inward and Outward Man

To explain the dynamics of human existence, we frequently refer to 2 Corinthians 4:16, which distinguishes between the inward and outward man. While 1 Thessalonians 5:23 could also be cited, 2 Corinthians 4:16 offers a simpler explanation. We define the inward man as our spirit combined with our mind, and the outward man as our body combined with our brain.

The outward man is perishable. This explains how we live out the reality of our spirit through our bodies. Deterioration in the brain, for example, can limit the activity of a person's mind. However, from a revelation standpoint, the spirit with the mind remains unaffected, even if there are limitations placed upon the person's body.

In 2 Corinthians, Paul metaphorically describes the body and brain as a tent, a cloth, or a building. He implies that the true individual is the inward man. In Luke 16, the Lord illustrates this dual reality of man. He describes Lazarus and the rich man as having both inward and outward aspects until their physical death.

## Reasoning, Memory, and the Power of Conviction

Upon death, they left their outward man on earth and continued their existence with their inward man. Critically, their inward man possessed an operational mind, and the characteristics of that mind—memory, tendencies, behavior, and consciousness—remained unchanged.

The rich man, for instance, reasoned about his condition and sought a solution, but Abraham called him to remember his past life. This demonstrates the reasoning and memory aspects of the mind. Abraham told him to "remember that in your lifetime you received your good things." Another example is found in Luke 24:45, where the Lord "opened their understanding that they might comprehend the Scriptures."

Through His explanation, Jesus removed the intellectual blinders, enabling them to connect and understand the scriptures. This process occurred within their reasoning. He expected them to make a decision and agree based on the evidence He presented. This leads us to the third aspect of our mind: our will, and the fourth aspect: our conviction.

Conviction is simply what we agree with. We can hold convictions even if we have forgotten the precise reasoning behind them, sometimes requiring a pause to recall that reasoning. This highlights the nature and power of conviction. Even if one's conduct does not align with a conviction, the conviction itself can persist, having been established through tested and satisfying reasoning.

## The Relationship Between Mind and Conscience

It is sometimes argued that if someone does not act in accordance with what they agree with, they don't truly agree with it. However, this is not always the case. Individuals can maintain a conviction even when the strength of their consciousness differs, leading to actions that do not match. This dynamic is central to Romans 6, where people affirmed the reality of redemption but acted contrary to it.

We now turn to the fifth aspect of the mind: the reckoning reality. This refers to being convinced about something (which can also be called faith) but not yet actively reckoning, or being conscious of, that reality. This reckoning is what we are conscious of and what we actively renew our mind towards. To explore this further, let us examine the word "conscience" in Titus chapter one, observing the interaction between "mind" and "conscience."

In Titus 1:15, Paul states, "To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; even their minds and conscience are defiled." Often, people interpret these texts carelessly, assuming, for example, that even inherently sinful things become pure. However, when Paul says "all things," he refers to "cosmos" things, like material objects.

## Understanding Purity and the Conscience

This discussion stems from a background where people reasoned through the Law of Moses, which depicted right and wrong via material things. Certain animals were declared holy, others profane. Material objects played a significant role in their system of holiness. We see this concept again in 1 Timothy chapter 4, where Paul speaks of those "having their conscience seared with a hot iron."

These individuals were "commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving." Paul reminds us that "every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving." This is also evident in Peter's vision in Acts chapter 10. Peter was shown all kinds of animals and instructed to "kill and eat," but he refused because he had "never eaten anything common or unclean."

Peter's conscience was conditioned by the Law, which formed his reasoning, embedded itself in his memory, and became his agreement. While there is fundamental truth in what the Law says about morality, there is a distinction between moral truth and its expression. Things created by God are not inherently evil in themselves.

Paul faced a challenge from those who still upheld the Law of Moses and contended against his message. He concludes that for "those who are defiled and unbelieving, their understanding and their conscience are defiled." The conscience is comprised of three elements, which I will elaborate on in the next episode.
