# Faith Stand (Part 2)

We continue our study on the faith stand, building on previous discussions regarding God's purpose and the roadmap to achieving it. We have established that growth and maturity are fostered through discipleship and the perfection of the saints, primarily occurring within the mind. Our prior focus explored various aspects of the mind, identifying a specific part responsible for our work, conduct, and actions. Addressing this crucial aspect of our mind is the precise reason for our current exploration of the faith stand.

## From Conviction to Reckoning

It is one matter to possess a conviction in our mind, and another entirely to possess the reckoning or conscious awareness of that conviction. Key biblical texts in this regard include Romans 6 and James 1. In Romans chapter 6, Paul poses a rhetorical question in verse three: "Do you not know that as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ?" He continues in Romans 6:6, stating, "Knowing this, that the old man was crucified with Christ," and again in Romans 6:9, "Knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more." In these instances, Paul assumes and affirms their existing knowledge.

However, by verse 11, Paul shifts his emphasis. He instructs, "Likewise, you also reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin." His concern is no longer solely about their knowledge but about their practical application of that knowledge. It is one thing to know a truth and quite another to actively reckon with it in light of God's Word.

The Greek word for "reckon" is *logizomai*, meaning to take account or to put into account. Just as an accountant only records existing realities, this implies that our reckoning is not about creating a reality but acknowledging one that is already present. It is one thing to inherently possess love, righteousness, or power, but a distinctly different practice to actively reckon with these inherent qualities.

## Standing Beside the Reality

In Romans 6:13, Paul introduces another significant word: "present." This term is central to understanding the faith stand. The Greek word for "present" is *paristemi*, derived from *para* (beside) and *histemi* (to stand). It fundamentally means "to stand beside." When one stands beside a reality, one is not fabricating or causing it to exist. Instead, one is simply recognizing and affirming it.

This concept is akin to acknowledging every good thing that is inherently yours in Christ. It involves pointing to spiritual realities and declaring, "I am a new creation; this is truly who I am." This appreciation for the reality of our identity is critically important. We are instructed to "present ourselves"—to stand beside who we truly are—as dead to sin and alive to God.

As believers, our disposition should be one of continuously presenting ourselves as we genuinely are. This means making declarations such as, "I am the righteousness of God. My only inclination is righteousness." By consistently reinforcing our identity in Christ, we move away from being enslaved to uncleanness and lawlessness. This act of presenting ourselves as new is what facilitates our new walk and transformed behavior.

## Transformation Through Renewing the Mind

This concept resurfaces in Romans 12:1, where Paul implores us to present our bodies as a living sacrifice. He calls this our "reasonable service," or our logical and rational worship. Since our nature has fundamentally changed, and we are now new creations, the logical next step is to stand beside this new identity.

Romans 12:2 then instructs us not to be conformed to this world but to be transformed by the renewing of our mind. Here, "renewing the mind" signifies more than merely acquiring new information, though knowledge certainly enlightens. It denotes a continuous refreshment and reorientation. This ongoing process of presenting or reckoning oneself brings about the profound transformation that enables us to walk in accordance with our new nature.

Transformation is the catalyst for our spiritual walk. Consider a child who possesses the innate ability to perform a task but lacks the capacity because further development is required. Similarly, while our new nature and knowledge are present, it is growth and transformation that empower us to consistently act in alignment with who we are meant to be. This transformation is profoundly brought about through the renewing of our minds.

## The Act of Faith

This deliberate act of standing in our identity is fundamentally an act of faith. As Paul affirms in 2 Corinthians 1:24, "Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are fellow workers for your joy; for by faith you stand." Every instruction to stand beside who we are, to affirm our identity, or to reckon with our reality, is inherently a stand of faith. Instructions to stand are, in essence, instructions to embody a faith stand.
