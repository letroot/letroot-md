# The Mind of Man (Part 12)

Welcome back to the Plerose podcast, your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill His purpose for your life. We are continuing our examination of the subject matter, the mind of man, and I hope this series is blessing you as we get into these critical truths. Our journey began by recognizing that God's purpose for us is sonship, where we walk as His children and heirs in fellowship with His nature and character. To carry out our natural and spiritual assignments, we must understand how this purpose unfolds through our daily devotional life and the roadmap of discipleship.

## Growth and Preparation for God’s Purpose

Having a roadmap for your life does not guarantee that you will actually carry out God's purpose. There is a vital need for discipleship, the perfecting of the saints, and the strengthening required to bear the burden of purpose. You may know the route and the turns to make, but that doesn't mean you have the fuel in your car to run the race. This spiritual growth and preparation is precisely why we are studying the mind of man today.

As the Lord Jesus taught, it is not enough to simply know God's will; we must prepare and act according to that will. This preparation is the process of spiritual growth and the perfecting of the saints that enables us to fulfill our calling. We have been focusing on Ephesians 4:17, where Paul explains that our walk must change as a result of the work of the church. We should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles do, specifically in the futility of their minds.

## The Condition of the Natural Mind

Paul provides four descriptions of why the natural man walks in futility, with a repeated emphasis on the state of the mind. He notes that their understanding is darkened and they are alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance and blindness within them. This blindness is often like wearing a blindfold; it is not a lack of sight, but rather being overwhelmed by falsehood and contrary information. In the natural state, our minds are designed to see truth, but they can become hardened or clogged by the barrage of this world.

We must be careful because, as long as we are in this world, there is a constant influence of things that can overwhelm our minds. Even if we say we don't agree with certain ideas, a constant barrage can blind us to the truths affecting our walk and the reality of who we are. Paul shows us that there is a reality to both the nature and the mind of man, but he places a strong emphasis on the mind's role. To understand this, we must look at the reality of man as a whole entity.

## The Inward Man and the Faculty of Reasoning

Scripture describes man as spirit, soul, and body, or as the outward and inward man according to 2 Corinthians 4:16. We can appreciate man as a spirit with a mind who also possesses a body with a brain. While these parts are codependent, we must place a serious premium on the inward man, which Paul describes as the true self compared to the "tent" of the body. Understanding this distinction helps us unlock how we grow spiritually and how our minds function within our spiritual nature.

In the New Testament, the Greek word *nous* is often used to describe the mind or understanding, specifically regarding our reasoning. For example, in Luke 24:45, Jesus opened the disciples' minds so they could comprehend the scriptures. Their reasoning had previously been closed to a particular grasp of the word, but His explanation made the unseen clear. This reasoning part of the mind is where we process observations, ruminate on information, and store things in our memory.

## Developing Spiritual Convictions

There is a difference between having information in your memory and having it as a conviction in your mind. You might have been raised with certain worldviews that you still remember, but you no longer hold them to be true. Through reasoning and pondering the evidence, you arrived at a conclusion that those views were incorrect. This is similar to how you know that 2+2 equals 4; you don't need to re-think it every time because you have already reached a firm conclusion.

This process happens frequently in Bible study as we examine scriptural data and interpret it through reasoning. Eventually, you arrive at a conclusion that you believe to be true based on sufficient evidence, and this becomes a stored conviction. The Greek word *dianoia* often refers to this faculty of the mind where you have "known through" to a specific conclusion. This is the "enlightened understanding" mentioned in Ephesians 1:18, representing the truths you have fully agreed to.

## Walking in the Truth

It is important to realize that you can agree with certain truths in God's word but still not be walking in them. You might intellectually accept that you are a new creation, a loved being in Christ, and the righteousness of God. You can even explain the reasoning behind these truths because they are part of your convictions. However, there is often a gap between knowing these realities and actually living them out in your daily life. 

In our next episode, we are going to take this one step further to explore why this disconnect exists. We will examine why someone who holds these convictions might still struggle to walk in the fullness of their identity. We trust you were blessed by today's episode and encourage you to stay in faith concerning what you have heard.
