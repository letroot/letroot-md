# The Pursuit of God's Purpose (Part 7)

## Understanding God’s Purpose as Sonship
Welcome back to the Pleros podcast, where we provide the daily dose of God's word needed for the renewal of your mind and transformation to fulfill His purpose. Presently, we are looking at the pursuit of God's purpose, which is built on the fact that God's purpose for us is sonship. He made us to be His children and His heirs, meaning He wants us to walk in fellowship with Him and reflect His nature and character. As His heirs, we are also called to carry out and fulfill the specific natural and spiritual assignments He has given us.

A central text in this regard is 1 Corinthians 7:17, where Paul states, "As God has distributed to each one, as God has called each one, so let him walk." This means that whatever conditions you were in when you were saved or realized God's purpose, those are the conditions where you are to begin your walk. For the believer, the natural state you are found in should be regarded as where God begins to unfold His work. So long as your current situation is not sinful, it serves as the starting point for your natural assignment.

## Navigating Opportunities and Personal Desires
Starting from these initial constraints, you have the liberty to proceed further and take advantage of opportunities that come your way. Beyond following these opportunities, you also have the privilege of pursuing your own desires within a general framework of stewardship. What matters is recognizing that in our natural work, we are not being gods to ourselves, but rather stewards of God. When we treat our natural work as a divine assignment, we are truly walking in His purpose as we do the part of the work the Lord has given us.

While we have the free will to decide much of what we do in the natural realm, it is also possible to receive specific instructions and direction from the Lord. However, we must operate with Bible intelligence, following the established templates and directions found in God’s word rather than simply hunting for exceptions. If an exception or a specific burden is meant for you, it will come of its own accord as you walk in fellowship. Your primary responsibility is to sync your heart with Him and start moving in the assignments already before you.

## The Principle of Maximum Productivity
When you find yourself engaged in any task, the core rule for pursuing your natural assignment is maximum productivity. This is a central apostolic teaching that is unfortunately not taught enough today, as people often focus more on the aspiration of personal success or greatness. We should instead redefine success as doing exactly what God wants you to fulfill. Even if your natural estate seems small or insignificant to others, you can find a sense of greatness in being faithful to your part of the Lord's work.

This emphasis on maximum productivity is seen throughout the New Testament, particularly in the writings of Paul to the Ephesians and Colossians. These texts instruct us to count our masters worthy of honor so that the name of God and His doctrine are not blasphemed. Even when serving believing masters, we are told to serve them well because the benefit goes to fellow believers. The consistent message is that our work ethic in the natural world is a reflection of our heart of stewardship toward God.

## Working Heartily as Unto the Lord
To summarize the pursuit of natural assignments, we must start where we are, take advantage of opportunities, and follow our desires when appropriate. Most importantly, we must remain constantly open to the leading of the Spirit in our regular lives and engage everything with maximum productivity. We should be obedient to those in authority with sincerity of heart, as if we are serving Christ Himself. This means avoiding "eye-service" where we only work hard to please men, and instead doing the will of God from the soul.

This change of mind is expected to happen when it comes to our natural assignments, as we must see our daily labor as the Lord's work. Whether you are an employee or an employer, your mindset should be that you are serving the Lord Christ. Knowing that you will receive the reward of the inheritance from Him should drive you to be faithful and genuine in everything you do. By training your mind to see your work this way, you ensure that you are truly fulfilling God's purpose in every aspect of your life.
