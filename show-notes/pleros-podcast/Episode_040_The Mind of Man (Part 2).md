# The Mind of Man (Part 2)

Welcome to Plaro's podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it. 

Welcome to another episode of the Plleos podcast. We serve you your daily dose of God's word that transforms you to fulfill God's purpose. We're looking at a new subject matter from the last episode, or we've begun looking at a new subject matter, which is the mind of man. I want us to jump right in. We are studying this because we have seen what God's purpose is for our life: Sonship. He has called us to be his child and his heirs, which means he has given us assignments to fulfill even as we walk in fellowship with him and in his character. 

## The Roadmap of Purpose and the Necessity of Growth

You have certain assignments to do, including your natural assignment and your spiritual assignment. You're only going to be able to do them as you fellowship with the Father. But then you need to grow. Even if you understand the journey, the pursuit, and the entire roadmap of what you need to do to fulfill God's purpose, you still will be unable to do what he has called you to without growth. In the pursuit of God's purpose, essentially we're given the roadmap of God's will.

Let me use an example. If we look at natural assignment, it starts from where you are, moves into opportunities that come to you, and then proceeds into your freedom of choice to do what you want to do. We looked at spiritual assignments; it requires commitment to the local church. Then you have to take different initiatives to go, which means you are not just in your space. You look for ways to cross roads with other people and interact with them. You go majorly physically, but equally or subsequently maybe virtually. 

You go, you preach, and then you are not only receptive of the word, you disciple them and help them to grow onto their own commitment to God's purpose, which makes you lead them. We can give you the roadmap of your natural assignment and the roadmap of your spiritual assignment. But when all that is said and done, even if you see the entire road, if you can't bear the burden in the way and manner that the Lord expects you to, then you need to be able to bear the burden of purpose. It's not enough that you simply know the journey; you must be able to bear the burden of purpose, and that requires growth.

## The Goal of Discipleship and the Role of the Mind

The major text we've seen on growth is Ephesians 4. The reason why we've centered on Ephesians 4 is the Lord told us in Matthew 28 that we need discipleship. In Luke 6, he explained that discipleship is us being perfected to become as the Master. Luke 6:40 says a disciple cannot be more than his master. In discipleship, the goal is to be just as the Master. You can't be more, but you can be just as. The word used there, "he that is perfectly trained" or "perfect," is the word *katiso*. 

The verb is then used in Ephesians 4 and verse 12 in its noun form, *katismos*. The Lord Jesus gave the leaders of the church to disciple us, and this discipleship has an end point. The end point of discipleship in verse 13 is said to be the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God. It doesn't stop there; it uses four descriptions. Two descriptions are talking about knowledge, and the other two are talking about stature or growth. 

We are to come to the entire knowledge of God's word, the unity of the faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God. It then says we are to come to the "perfect man," to the "measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ." Verse 13 shows there is this end point of knowledge and this end point of growth that the Lord has set for us. But if you notice, knowledge is about the mind. You need to know; that's something that has to do with the mind. 

Also, the perfect measure of stature of the fullness of Christ is also about the mind. We can make the mistake of thinking that there's a mind part we know, but when we grow, it is no longer a mind issue but something happening to our spirit. Sometimes people use illustrations to say that if I look at your spirit man in the spirit realm, is he malnourished or battered? That manner of thinking about our spirit is very wrong and could be a real hindrance to our spiritual growth. We need to be clear that the place that defines the entirety of our growth is our mind.

## Analyzing the Walk of the Gentiles

I'm going to zoom in on that fact in Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 17. Paul, after he told them about the work that the church would do to them, says, "This I say therefore and testify in the Lord, that you should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk." Paul is simply saying that on the premise of what the church has done, our walk is to change. You notice the word "therefore." On what the church does, your walk ought to change. You shouldn't walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk. 

"Rest of the Gentiles" simply refers to the unbelieving folks. You would have to appreciate the mindset of the author as well as his audience. There was the understanding that the reality of salvation was primarily for the Jews, and in that sense, the Gentiles were outside. Now, it's something he had resolved in Ephesians 2, but it's still their way of speaking when they say "rest of the Gentiles" to talk about those who are yet to believe the gospel—those who are yet to have the life of God, the light of God, and the nature of God in them.

When he says he doesn't want you to walk as the rest of those who don't believe the gospel do, the question is: how do they walk? It says they walk in the "futility of their mind." All the phrases he used from Ephesians 4:17 to Ephesians 4:18 to describe why the Gentiles walk the way they do are phrases that relate to the mind except one. He uses five phrases: futility of their mind, their understanding darkened, alienated from the life of God, ignorance that is in them, and blindness of their heart. Only one is unrelated to the mind, which is "alienated from the life of God." That is talking about their nature; they do not have the life of God. 

## The Influence of Nature on the Mind

Let's see Ephesians 2:1 to buttress the point. It says, "you he made alive who were dead in trespasses and sins." Everyone who is a believer was once dead in trespasses and sin because the reign of sin and death in this world eventually takes its toll before our salvation. You were dead in trespasses and sins in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air. He is describing the same walk he was talking about in Ephesians 4. 

At this point in Ephesians 2, he says nothing about the mind, but the next verse talks about the mind again. For now, it's simply saying you were dead. That was your nature, and you were walking as the dead—physically alive, but spiritually dead. You were walking according to the course of this world because the state of death you were in is a state of darkness that defines the world—a state of immorality and unrighteousness. You were walking according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the sons of disobedience.

Verse three says amongst whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lust of the flesh. At this point, it is still the nature—the lust of the flesh. Chapter one says you were dead in trespasses, walking according to the course of the world similar to other unbelieving folks. Then it says you were fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind. He is saying there were desires that pertained to our nature, but they had their reign on our mind. They were the dominant force on our mind.

Those desires of the flesh were on the mind. Romans 6:12 says do not let sin reign in your mortal body. Sin is being used as a slave master. It reigns via its desires. Sin's propaganda is going on in this world, and if one receives and accepts that, the person is going to walk accordingly because they receive it on their mind. He is saying you used to walk in your nature of the flesh and the desire of your mind. It had taken over your mind.

## The Imperative of Mental Transformation

There is the nature you had, but your walk was a product of that nature and your mind. It's possible for someone to have a contrary nature and a contrary mind, leading to a specific walk. It is also possible for someone to have a contrary thought that is much more refined than others, but they will still have a walk that reflects the flesh, whether it's in pride, selfishness, or self-righteousness. Once there's no faith in the redemptive work of Christ Jesus, there's a self-dependence going on. 

Without redemption, you are not relying entirely on God; there is a pride involved. That's why Jesus says the meek will inherit the earth. Putting your faith in Jesus is an acknowledgement that "I am poor in spirit." Blessed are the poor in spirit; blessed are the meek. These are descriptions of people who recognize something is wrong and need help that only God can provide through redemption. This is why not believing the gospel is fatal; no matter how well you have refined your mind, it is still being done under the premise of self-righteousness. 

The mind is not automatically changed at salvation. Ephesians 2 points out that the mind Paul picks up in Ephesians 4 is a mind that we had before. He is charging us that, via the work of the church, we are not meant to walk in that same mind again. Something ought to have changed about that mind. If nothing has changed, we're going to walk just the way we used to before. You need to appreciate the role of your mind when it comes to your walk in God's purpose. Everything boils down to that.
