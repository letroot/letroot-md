# The Reality of God's Purpose (Part 9)

The subject we have been focusing on is God's purpose. If you have been following, you have learned some things and now understand precisely what God's purpose is. One crucial point we've discussed is that you cannot truly know someone's purpose except through revelation.

## Understanding Purpose Through Revelation

Many things can be known about an individual without revelation. For instance, I could meet you and observe various physical attributes like your height, hair color, or skin complexion. However, one thing I cannot ascertain merely through observation and reasoning is what you are ultimately trying to accomplish—your purpose. Attempting to deduce it from your actions alone could be misleading, as those actions might serve as a cover for your true intentions.

Knowing your purpose depends on your personal integrity and the revelation of that purpose. The same principle applies to understanding God's purpose. It is grounded in the integrity of His person, as He is truth itself, and in the revelation He has provided through the written Word. While God may give you a personal revelation of His purpose for you, it must always align with His validated, direct revelation found in scripture. Jesus, through His life, validated the truths of both the Old and New Testaments.

To find an objective answer to God's purpose, rather than a subjective one, we must consult His Word. We have already established that God's purpose is sonship, as detailed in Ephesians 1:5 and 1:9. God created us for this purpose. We have further elaborated on sonship, particularly from Romans 8:15, where Paul explains that we have received the spirit of adoption, enabling us to cry, "Abba Father."

## The Spirit of Sonship

The phrase "Abba Father" reveals a natural aspect of our relationship with God when we possess the spirit of sonship. It signifies that our interactions with Him are characterized by familiarity and natural expressions, indicative of a close relationship. Romans 8 continues to unfold the realities associated with this spirit. Romans 8:16 states that the Spirit of sonship, in conjunction with our own spirit, bears witness that we are children of God.

This fusion of our spirit with the Spirit of God occurs at the moment of salvation, providing clear evidence of our divine parentage. The passage further elaborates that if we are children, then we are also heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ. This indicates that sonship encompasses two key realities: being a child and being an heir.

We have explored this reality through Galatians 4, clarifying that sonship primarily emphasizes the heir factor. In that cultural context, one could be a child but not yet considered a "son" in the sense of an heir. While historically "son" often referred to males, from the perspective of God's purpose, sonship is not limited by gender. Paul highlights God's clearest depiction of sonship with the entire nation of Israel in Romans 9:4.

## The Dual Nature of Sonship: Child and Heir

As God's child, we are called to fellowship with Him, walking in His nature and character. This involves a continuous connection with the Father and a reflection of His attributes. However, the other aspect of this equation—being heirs of God—requires further explanation. To be an heir simply means you have been allotted a part, a portion, or the entirety of what another person owns.

Typically, we associate receiving an inheritance with someone's passing. However, the term "heir" does not inherently necessitate the death of the person making the allotment. If it did, it would contradict God's nature, as He is immortal. One way an heir can receive an allotment is through mechanisms like trust funds, where a child is designated ownership or an investment to manage at a predetermined time.

Inheritance, then, is the concept of allotting something to someone based on specific conditions. In our case, faith in Christ is the condition for being an heir of God. Some might interpret Galatians 4 as suggesting maturity is the condition, but that text actually contrasts the era before Christ with the present era. While a lack of understanding can impede our experience of being an heir, our status as an heir is established because God has already allotted things to us.

## Natural and Spiritual Inheritance

We share a joint inheritance with Christ because God owns creation, and He has allotted it to those who have faith in Him. Beyond this joint inheritance, God's Word also speaks of a specific or individualized inheritance allotted to each person. We see this in our natural assignments, as discussed in Colossians 3 and Ephesians 6. Whatever good work you find yourself doing naturally at the point of salvation can be understood as God's allotment to you.

God, in His foreknowledge, is aware of where we begin our journey with Him. Therefore, your natural vocation is often within God’s orchestration and providence. Beyond the natural, there is also a spiritual inheritance. This is evident in Acts 1, where Judas is described as losing his "lot" or "portion" in the ministry, using terms related to inheritance.

This inheritance factor is directly tied to ministry, implying that each of us has a specific portion of ministry to fulfill. While some might argue this was exclusive to the twelve apostles, a careful reading of scripture reveals that every believer has a "part" or "lot." Peter uses these same terms when addressing Simon in Acts 8:21, equating "part" and "lot." Consequently, every individual saint has a part in the ministry of the body of Christ.

As 1 Corinthians 12:27 states, "Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually." The word "individually" here signifies that you are a component part of the entire body. You have both a natural assignment and a spiritual assignment, which we will explore in greater detail in the next episode.
