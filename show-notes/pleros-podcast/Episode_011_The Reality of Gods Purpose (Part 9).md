# The Reality of God's Purpose (Part 9)

Welcome to Plerose podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Good day and welcome to Plerose podcast, your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. The subject matter that has been our focus is God's purpose. By now, if you've been following the podcast, you have learned some things and seen what precisely God's purpose is. One of the things we mentioned is that you can't know someone's purpose except by revelation.

## The Revelation of Purpose

You can know many things about someone without revelation. I could meet you and tell different things about you, such as your height, the color of your hair, or the complexion of your skin. However, one thing I cannot tell by observing you and reasoning is what you're trying to accomplish, which is your purpose. I could try to figure it out from your actions, but that could mislead me because you might be doing things as a cover for the real thing you're trying to do.

Knowing your purpose relies on the integrity of your person and the revelation of that purpose. It's the same thing with God's purpose, based on the integrity of His person being truth Himself and the revelation He has given through the written word. He could give you a personal revelation of His purpose for you, but it must be subject to His validated direct revelation, which is the scripture. In the fulfillment of the truth of God in the person of Jesus, He validates the Old and New Testament texts.

When we ask what His purpose is and we want an objective answer rather than a subjective one, we must go into His word. We have already seen that God's purpose is sonship, as mentioned in Ephesians 1:5 and 1:9. God made us for this purpose, and we have explained what sonship is particularly from Romans 8:15. There, Paul explains that we have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry "Abba Father."

## The Spirit of Sonship

The mention of "Abba Father" shows us that something is natural about our relationship with God when we have the spirit of sonship. We have words and expressions of familiarity when we interact with Him, indicating a natural, familiar manner of relating. The following verses in Romans 8 explain the reality that pertains to this spirit and what it entails. The first thing we see in Romans 8:16 is the evidence that we are children of God.

The evidence is given by the spirit of sonship in conjunction with our own spirit. This is possible because our spirit has been entirely fused with the Spirit of God at the point of salvation. The evidence provided by these two spirits is that we are children of God. Furthermore, it says that if we are children, then we are heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ. This tells us that sonship has two realities: being a child and being an heir.

We have examined this reality from Galatians 4 as well, making it clear that sonship is majorly about the heir factor. You could be a child but not be called a son in this context because you are not an heir. In that culture, the terminology of "son" was a reality often fulfilled by the male, but from the standpoint of God's purpose, it is not limited to males. God’s clearest depiction of sonship was with the people of Israel as a whole, as Paul noted in Romans 9:4.

## Defining the Role of an Heir

As God's child, we are called to fellowship with Him and walk in His nature and character. This involves a continual walk in fellowship with the Father and reflecting His character. However, the other part of the equation where we are heirs of God needs some unpacking. To be an heir simply means you are one who has been allotted a part, a portion, or the whole of what a person owns.

Usually, we think of an heir receiving an inheritance only when someone passes away. However, the word "heir" itself does not necessitate the death of the person giving the allotment. If it did, it would be a contradiction of God’s nature, as it is impossible for Him to die. One way being an heir happens is through things like trust funds, where a child is allotted ownership or an investment to take charge of at a given time.

Inheritance is the concept of allotting something to someone because they fulfill certain conditions. In this case, faith in Christ is the condition for being an heir of God. Some suggest maturity is the condition based on Galatians 4, but that text was actually making a contrast between the period prior to Christ and the current era. While ignorance can hinder your walk in the reality of being an heir, you are an heir because God has allotted things to you.

## Natural and Spiritual Allotments

We have a joint inheritance with Christ because God owns creation, and He has allotted it to those who have faith in Him. Yet, God's word also tells us there is a severed or specific inheritance allotted to each individual. We see this in our natural assignments, as discussed in Colossians 3 and Ephesians 6. Whatever you find your hands to do naturally at the point of salvation is taken as God's allotment to you if it is good.

God, in His foreknowledge, is aware of where we begin our walk with Him. Where you find yourself in your natural vocation is within God’s orchestration and providence. Beyond the natural, there is also a spiritual inheritance. We see this in Acts 1, where it is mentioned that Judas lost his "lot" or "portion" in the ministry, using the same root word for inheritance.

This inheritance factor is relative to ministry, meaning there is a portion of ministry for us to fulfill. While some might say this was exclusive to the twelve apostles, a careful reading of scripture shows that every believer has a "part" or "lot." Peter used these same terms when speaking to Simon in Acts 8:21, equating the words "part" and "lot." Every individual saint has a part in the ministry of the body of Christ.

In 1 Corinthians 12:27, it says, "Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually." The word "individually" there means members of a part, signifying that you make up a part of the whole body. You have a natural assignment and a spiritual assignment, which we will make clearer in the coming episode. Thank you for joining us today.
