# The Reality of Sonship and Purpose

We have discussed the essential role of the gospel as truth in our lives. This truth reveals God's ultimate purpose for humanity: sonship. As we've explored, sonship encompasses two key realities: being children of God and being heirs of God. This episode continues our study on the pursuit of this divine purpose.

## Embracing Personal Significance in God's Purpose

Our focus today is not merely on identifying God's purpose—we have established that it is sonship. Instead, we delve into the practicalities: how do we pursue it? What are the concrete steps we must take? A significant emphasis here is recognizing the profound importance of your individual place and part within God's grand design.

It is one thing to have received the gospel and another to genuinely accept the reality of God's purpose for your life. Even with this acceptance, a common challenge is a prevailing attitude of indifference. Many believers are not as driven as they could be, often due to a misunderstanding of what purpose truly entails.

When considering our status as "heirs of God," we observe a stark difference in how figures like Jesus and Paul recognized their inheritance compared to the common perspective today. Jesus lived with an unwavering sense of having a specific work to complete. He declared, "I must finish the work that has been given to Me." A similar conviction resonated in the Apostle Paul's life, as recorded in Acts chapter 20, verse 24.

Paul proclaimed, "None of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself that I may finish my race with joy, the ministry which I received of the Lord Jesus, to testify of the gospel of the grace of God." He viewed his spiritual assignment within God's purpose as his personal "race." This statement reveals his intense desire to complete the specific task entrusted to him by the Lord. Paul possessed a profound sense of personal significance, a recognition we are all meant to cultivate concerning our own roles.

## The Exclusivity of Your Divine Calling

Consider Paul's instruction in 1 Corinthians chapter 7, verse 17: "As God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk." This verse highlights a crucial truth: God has allotted a unique portion to you, distinct from what He has given to others. This individual distribution underscores a sense of exclusivity and a significant weight of responsibility.

If your specific portion of God's work remains undone, it will stay undone unless you are the one to complete it. The magnitude or visibility of another person's contribution does not diminish the importance of your own. While God will ultimately ensure the fulfillment of His overall plan, our faithfulness to the part He has allotted to us is paramount.

Paul emphasizes this principle further when addressing various life circumstances: "Whatever condition you found yourself in when called, let each one abide in that calling where he was called." This establishes a fundamental rule for how we are to walk in faith and purpose: we begin precisely where we are. God takes into account your state at the time of your calling and does not impose additional burdens based on past circumstances.

Whether you were called while circumcised or uncircumcised, such external identity markers or social statuses are irrelevant to your walk with God. What truly matters, Paul asserts, is keeping God's commandments. In verse 20, he reiterates, "Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called." This teaching provides practical guidance for living out our purpose and serving God right where we are.

## Diligence in Our Natural Assignments

This principle extends directly to our natural, everyday assignments. Were you called while in servitude? Do not let it trouble you, but if you have the opportunity to gain freedom, certainly use it. Paul clarifies that one called in the Lord while enslaved is the Lord's freedman, and one called while free is Christ's slave. Regardless of our social status, we were bought at a price, meaning we are ultimately serving Christ in whatever role we find ourselves.

The foundational rule for our natural assignments is to begin exactly where we are. Whether you are an employee, an employer, a freelancer, or a student, your current condition at the point of salvation and enlightenment is your starting point. Embrace that calling and faithfully pursue God's purpose within it.

If you are currently unemployed, you must still remain diligent and productive. This means actively seeking employment, interning, or developing new skills. Idleness is not an option for those called by God. His Word encourages us to view our natural endeavors as integral to His broader assignment. Be actively engaged, working, and proactively taking advantage of every opportunity to grow and improve, demonstrating excellence in all you do.
