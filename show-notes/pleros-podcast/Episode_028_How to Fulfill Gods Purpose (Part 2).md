Welcome to Pleros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

All right, welcome back to the Pleros podcast. We are pressing forward with our new study on how to fulfill God's purpose. This is your daily dose of God's word, transforming you to fulfill God's purpose, and we've been making quite some progress. We have seen that God's purpose for our lives is sonship; that's why we're here. The Lord Jesus's work of redemption was to bring us back into that purpose that the Lord has for us.

At the point we are saved, we shouldn't just have the joy of being saved from damnation. We should also have the recognition of why it was so important to the Father and our Lord that we be saved. He didn't save us just to save us; He saved us for the reason that He made us, which means He saved us for His purpose. What He desired eternally, for which reason He saved us, is His purpose of sonship.

## Understanding Our Inheritance and Assignment

We've examined what sonship is and what it means to be His child. It means we are called to fellowship with Him and to walk in His nature and character, which is primarily fulfilled by a life of prayer and devotion. On the other hand, when we are heirs of God, we have assignments given to us. Having God's spirit is like God assigning the entirety of His nature to us.

There's one sense in which you can say you are an heir of God because you have the Spirit of God. The very Spirit we have is called the Spirit of sonship, which means that within that Spirit is still the reality of being an heir. There is something allotted to you there, and at that stage, you can say the entirety of creation is allotted to you as a joint inheritance. We see texts that say the meek inherit the earth and that Abraham is heir of the world.

Within that reality of joint inheritance, there is still severed or individual inheritance. Across scripture, we see our natural inheritance as well as our spiritual inheritance, which includes natural and spiritual assignments. We have looked at these and it is now important for us to press forward. How do we pursue God's purpose and our specific assignments?

## The Framework of Natural and Spiritual Assignments

For the natural assignment, there are five things that unfold. You start from where you are and take advantage of opportunities that come to you. You use the world as you desire when you can, while always remaining open to the leading of the Spirit. Finally, you ensure that you are maximize the opportunity and remain maximally productive.

For our spiritual assignment, it begins with commitment to discipleship in a local church. You will always find that God orchestrates your steps to a family, as Psalm 68 says He puts the solitary in families. You should be faithful and committed there unless your steps are ordered elsewhere by the truth of the word and the leading of the Spirit. God does not leave you in the dark or tell you not to attend any local church at all.

Beyond commitment, you must "go" to reach more people, whether physically or through virtual means. You must know what you're meant to do: preach, proclaim, and publicize the message. Then, you are supposed to disciple those who receive the message and continue in these things until leadership. You can max out the life of purpose by living this way, just as we see in the examples of Priscilla, Erastus, and Onesimus.

## The Responsibility of Knowing God's Will

Having said all of that, I want us to press on further to how we fulfill the assignment. We're going to start with a very lovely text in Luke chapter 12 that has blessed and guided me for a long time. It says that the servant who knew his master's will and did not prepare or do according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes. But he who did not know, yet committed things deserving of stripes, shall be beaten with few.

For everyone to whom much is given, from him much will be required. When I read this many years ago, it made a massive impression on my heart. The second verse particularly struck me because it implies the burden of knowing is on you. From that point, I knew I didn't have the right to outsource the knowing to someone else.

You are not absolved of the responsibility to ensure that what you are told is right. You better be sure that it's correct because it's on you to have clarity. He that does not know will yet be judged for not knowing. It is your duty to ensure that you have clarity and that you truly know the master's will.

## Preparation Before Performance

Our focus is on the servant who knew the master's will but did not prepare. If you are a listener of this podcast, you have passed the first phase because you know God's will. You know you are His child, you know you are called to fellowship and devotion, and you know He has both natural and spiritual assignments for you. You can't go pretending that you don't know.

Now that you know, He says you have to prepare and do according to His will. Notice that He said "prepare" before He said "do." This is a challenge because even if you have degrees and have improved your skills, there is still a need for a specific type of preparation. We are pointing to a preparation that the church gives, which eventually affects what you do in the natural world.

This preparation is not for some Christian agenda to remove all darkness, but to prepare your heart to be salt and light. We are called to be examples and preservers against decadence and corruption. The preparation for your spiritual assignment takes us to Ephesians chapter 4. This training ensures that we are capable of fulfilling the purpose God has for our lives. We will kick off from there in the next one.
