# Faith Stand (Part 5)

This discussion focuses on the concept of the 'faith stand,' a crucial subject building upon our previous explorations of God's purpose and the roadmap for that journey. Fulfilling God's purpose for our lives necessitates spiritual growth.

As we have discussed, this growth occurs primarily in our mind. Spiritual growth is not a transformation of our spirit, which is already perfect, complete, and divine. Instead, it is a development within our mental faculties. We previously examined the seven aspects of the human mind, with a particular emphasis on 'reckoning' or consciousness.

## From Knowledge to Reckoning

Our examination of this subject often begins with Romans chapter 6. In this passage, Paul clarifies to his audience that mere knowledge of God's word is insufficient for their practical walk in it. He repeatedly affirmed their knowledge, sometimes rhetorically, sometimes directly. For example, verse 3 states, "Do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?" Verse 6 adds, "knowing that our old man was crucified with Him," and verse 9, "knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more."

Knowing God's word is distinct from acting upon it. This action is not merely an exercise of willpower, but rather a conscious act of 'reckoning ourselves.' Romans 6:11 instructs, "Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord." When we gain knowledge of God's word, reckoning is the essential next step. We are to reckon ourselves, using the Greek word *logizomai*. James also uses a negative form, *paralogizomai*, in James 1:21, referring to deceiving oneself. One reason an individual may hear the Word but not apply it is a failure to properly reckon, or align, themselves with its truth.

## Defining the Faith Stand

The concept of 'reckoning' is further illuminated by the word 'to present,' found in Romans 6:13, 6:19, and significantly, in Romans 12:1. Paul instructs us to "present our members as instruments of righteousness" and to avoid presenting ourselves as instruments of unrighteousness. This word, "present," is foundational to our understanding of the 'faith stand.'

The Greek word for "present" is *paristēmi*, derived from two words: *para*, meaning "beside," and *histēmi*, meaning "to stand." Thus, *paristēmi* means "to stand beside." In Romans 12:1, Paul appeals, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present" — or stand beside — "your bodies a living sacrifice."

An interesting distinction in Romans 12:1-2 is how conformity and transformation are presented. Conforming to the world appears to be a passive default, requiring no effort: "do not be conformed to this world." However, transformation, which occurs through the renewing of the mind, demands intentional effort, especially given the pervasive influence of sin and death in our world.

## Transformation and the Proving of God's Will

Without intentionality in renewing our minds, the personal change necessary to fulfill God's will will not manifest. Transformation enables us to "prove" — to put into practice and demonstrate — the good, acceptable, and perfect will of God. This "proving" is an active demonstration, showing the reality of God's will through our actions. It is important to note that God does not have three separate wills; rather, these adjectives describe the singular, comprehensive will of God as being inherently good, acceptable, and complete. Therefore, fulfilling the entirety of God's will in our lives is directly dependent on this transformation achieved through the renewing of our mind.

The renewing of our mind is intrinsically linked to 'presenting ourselves.' This act of presentation brings a refreshing to our minds. As previously established, "present" (*paristēmi*) means "to stand beside," and this foundational "stand" is precisely what we refer to as the faith stand. This concept is echoed in 2 Corinthians 1:24, which states, "for by faith you stand."

Our Christian journey is characterized by a continuous 'faith stand,' not merely a single act of faith, as at salvation. It is an ongoing, deliberate posture of faith that facilitates transformation and empowers us to walk in God's purpose. Paul highlights this in 1 Thessalonians 3:8, expressing his joy that they were "standing fast in the Lord," equating their faith with this steadfast standing. Numerous scriptural instructions to "stand" pertain to our faith response to the knowledge of God's word. Recognizing that faith is central to our stand and growth, understanding the core principles of faith becomes paramount. As Colossians 2:6 instructs, "As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him." This echoes the fundamental principle of faith: "with the heart one believes, and with the mouth confession is made" (Romans 10:10).

## The Principle of Heart and Mouth

This principle is clearly articulated in Mark 11:23-24. While individuals may superficially mimic faith through vocal declarations, true faith originates in the heart. Conviction is a prerequisite for the reckoning that leads to transformation. As the Lord stated, "whoever says to this mountain, 'Be removed and be cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says."

The interplay between the heart and the mouth is central to the principle of faith, a concept evident even in Old Testament texts like Joshua 1:8: "This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night." This meditation, involving the heart, ensures the Word does not depart from the mouth, embodying a proactive faith stand. The intimate interaction between our heart and mouth is crucial for faith. Our understanding of salvation illustrates this perfectly: we hear God's word, it brings conviction to our heart, and then we speak, leading to salvation. However, the operation of this principle differs when applied to the ongoing 'faith stand' that drives our spiritual work and the continuous renewing of the mind.
