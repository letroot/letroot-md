# The Pursuit of God's Purpose (Part 5)

Welcome to Plaro’s podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God’s word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God’s purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God’s word taught today. Let’s get right into it.

All right, welcome to another episode of the Plaro's podcast. This is your daily dose of God’s word transforming you to fulfill God’s purpose. We have been making some progress in our learnings and our studies, and we have seen some things already. Specifically, we have seen the place that we ought to give the gospel in our lives. 

We have said that we shouldn’t regard the gospel as just about our salvation and then that’s all there is to it. That’s going to be a shallow and incomplete understanding of the gospel. While many times the gospel is described through our salvation, two things ought to come to mind the moment we hear that word: what we are being saved from as well as what we are saved to. 

## The Revelation of Sonship

Calling the gospel salvation or redemption should give us a wholesome view of what it is about. Precisely, we said that we should hold and treat the gospel as the truth of our life. In that place of truth, one of the core answers it gives us is the answer to the question of purpose. We have seen the objective revelation of God about His purpose for our lives: the fact that He made the world for sonship. 

I’ve tried to encourage us to stick strictly with that direct revelation because, oftentimes, when we do otherwise, we are standing on shaky grounds. I’ve heard many descriptions of God's purpose, such as "knowing Jesus and making Him known." While we can reconcile that with sonship, it can come across as off if we don't understand the entire scope. To know Jesus is a prototype example of sonship because He is the central example of the reason for all creation.

Another way we hear people describe God's purpose is to say that the reason for our lives is to glorify God. Certain texts can be used to express an aspiration that we ought to have to glorify Him, and again, we could reconcile that with God’s purpose. However, you are better served just saying the real thing. If we are asked what God’s purpose is, we are best served by just saying it is sonship. 

## Starting Where You Are

Sonship is what pleases God, what glorifies God, and what leads us to carry out His will for our lives. I encourage you to wire your understanding this way so that you can focus your pursuits accordingly. You don’t want a situation where you are found knowing God’s will but ignoring it and not doing it. As Luke 12 points out, those who know but do not prepare will face a different judgment than those who did not know.

Having said all of that, let’s take it back to where we were. We have seen that God’s purpose is sonship, which means we are called to fellowship and to walk in His nature. On the other hand, we are called to the assignments He has given to us, which include both a natural assignment and a spiritual assignment. Now that we have seen the reality of it, we are looking at the pursuit of that purpose.

The general rule when it comes to the pursuit of God’s purpose is to start where you are. Our cardinal text in that regard has been 1 Corinthians chapter 7 and 17: "As God has parted to each one, as God has called each one, so let him walk." This particular text is in the context of marriage, but it extends to other things as a rule laid down in the churches. 

## The Liberty of Choice

This means that the state in which we get saved or find out about God’s purpose is foreknown by Him and is where He wants us to begin our walk with Him. Whether you are circumcised or not, continue in that state. Whether you are poor or rich, start from there. Your walk with God starts exactly where you are, rather than fighting against it.

If you are a slave, don’t be bothered about it. In our world today, we could take that as if you are an employee, a career person, a freelancer, or a business owner. It is precisely within God’s own orchestration or providence for you to begin your walk in His purpose from there. Rather than fighting that, it says rather use it and begin to do what the Lord wants you to do.

From there, we said two other things about your natural assignment. Start where you are at, and if you can be made free, use it. This is about taking advantage of opportunities. In 1 Corinthians 7:31, it says those who use this world as not misusing it. This is a case of someone freely of the person’s own volition using the world as the person desires.

## Pursuing Spiritual Assignments

This is an important rule when it comes to the pursuit of our natural assignment. We have that privilege of the liberty of our will and desire to choose what we want to do. While circumstances give us boundaries of options, our imagination gives us another level of liberty in pursuit. This is quite different from spiritual assignments, which are more restrictive. 

You might say you'd like to be like such and such a person, but that may not be what you are meant to do. However, in your natural assignment, you are free to do what you want to do. This is your choice, and it will be very important that you acknowledge that so you can pursue your career without any fear of whether you are doing what God wants.

Now when it comes to spiritual assignments, how exactly are we meant to carry them out? Again, we find that the rules are the same as natural assignments: start where you are. The very instructions that explain our natural assignment which is ministry to us are instructions that you carry out from where you are, except when otherwise specifically stated. 

If there is going to be an exception, you don't need to go hunting for it; an exception will come looking for you. That itself is a rule in God's word as long as you are carrying out everything else in His purpose, which is your devotional life. You don't go looking for exceptions; rather, you go with what you have been instructed directly by God. 

Mark 16:15 says "go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature." He just said "go," so from where you are now, the instruction is to go. It means it starts from where you are, and that's the rule. The exception may come looking for you, but that is not for you to look for. Start with the rule, and we'll continue from there in the next episode.
