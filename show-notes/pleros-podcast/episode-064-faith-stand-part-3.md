# Faith Stand (Part 3)

Welcome back to the Plle podcast. This is your daily dose of God's word, transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. We pray that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. I trust that you are going to receive everything we're going to be teaching today on the faith stand.

Presently, what led us to the study on the faith stand is we have seen what God's purpose is. We have seen the journey of God's purpose and the need for growth to fulfill that purpose. We have seen that growth happens on the mind, which is the domain where transformation occurs.

## The Mind and the Abundance of the Heart

One aspect of our mind is so important to our work that it essentially makes for our walk. There are a number of texts that talk about this aspect, such as where the Lord spoke about how out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks. The "abundance" there cannot be your conviction alone, because there is no plenteousness to a single conviction that makes for an abundance.

If I say out of the abundance of your heart you believe 1 plus 1 is two, it doesn't take an abundance to believe that. You might have many angles of reasoning that lead you to the conclusion, but you hold that conviction as one. However, if that truth is something to be conscious about, there could be a volume or an abundance of how much consciousness of that conviction you have.

What we're looking at presently is the "faith stand," which affects these aspects that become so fundamental in our growth. In the teaching of the Lord Jesus and the apostles, what affects this part of our mind is faith. If you ask why you are growing or not growing, it could be one of two things: your knowledge or your faith stand.

## Distinguishing Knowledge from the Faith Stand

There's a reason why we call it a faith stand, because faith is a very big word and not everything about faith is a stand. For example, your salvation did not happen by a faith stand; it happened by just one moment of faith. Expecting results of a different level to happen the same way as salvific faith is an error.

Your spiritual growth is not just going to be one instance of believing. If you think that, you are not being honest with scripture because it doesn't work like that. Your spiritual life is going to happen via a faith stand, which is an ongoing stance, whereas salvation was one stance of faith and that is it.

In Romans chapter 6, Paul referenced the knowledge of his audience in a rhetorical manner three times. In verse 3, he says, "Do you not know as many of you as were baptized into Christ were baptized into his death?" He assumes that they know they are already dead with Christ, meaning their old man is dead and gone.

In Romans 6:6, he affirms their knowledge that our old man has been crucified with him so that we should no longer be slaves of sin. Verse 9 then says, "Knowing that Christ having been raised from the dead dies no more; death no longer has dominion over him." Knowledge is first in our faith after salvation.

## From Intellectual Knowing to Spiritual Reckoning

In Ephesians 1:15, Paul says that after he heard of their faith in the Lord Jesus, he did not cease to pray for them. He desired that God would give them the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him. Just because you have believed on Jesus does not mean you automatically have the full knowledge of your faith.

That you know does not imply immediate growth. Knowledge is a prerequisite to growth, but knowledge itself is not what growth is. We might sometimes describe growth in that manner because of the stability and certainty that knowledge brings, but there is more to the process.

Someone that is stable and certain has a level of maturity, but they might still be quite weak in some fundamental areas of their life. What does Paul say should happen after we know? Verse 11 says we should reckon, which is a different word from just knowing; it is taking into account, affirming, and recognizing yourself to be dead to sin and alive to God.

Verse 13 particularly says to present your members as alive unto God. That word "present," or *paristemi*, means to stand beside. We are to stand beside ourselves as who we are now in Christ. Romans 12:1 uses that word again when it says to present your bodies as a living sacrifice.

## The Act of Presenting as Reasonable Worship

The fact that the word is in the plural means each person should present their own person as a whole. This is not an error on the part of the translators; this is indeed what the apostle himself was saying. Present yourself as alive, as holy, and as acceptable to God.

Paul says this is your logical or reasonable worship, using the word *latreia*. This word essentially takes us into discussing prayer and temple service. It shows us that faith happens in this domain of prayer, which involves our temple engagement with God.

You present yourself, and he describes that act as renewing your mind. You are refreshing your mind with the truth that you are a new creation, born of God and dead to sin. By so doing, you are transformed rather than being conformed to this world.

A lot of church traditions, including the oldest orthodox institutions, have ideas like chants and repeated confessions. These are baked into the culture of the church because it is part of our faith to make these affirmations. It is not strange that we have certain affirmations we make about ourselves.

## Personal Responsibility and Walking by Faith

In 2 Corinthians 1:24, Paul says that he does not have dominion over their faith. He is reluctant to be tough because being tough isn't necessarily going to change someone. You still have the will to do what you are going to do, and leaders cannot usurp that will.

Leaders can supply the knowledge and the inspiration, but they are only fellow workers for your joy. Eventually, if it's faith, it is on you to act. This is a comfort people need to have, especially if they are weary of an overbearing nature in the church.

While there might be wrong ways of carrying out activities, the church's role is to give you the order and inspiration to act on God's word. Nobody can take you and make you act; that is your faith. You have to act on the word yourself because by faith you stand.

If standing is by faith, this act of presenting ourselves operates in that same realm. Paul tells the Colossians that as they have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so they should walk in him. The only way you are going to walk in Christ is the same way you received him, which was by faith.

The principles of faith are the same even if the expressions differ between salvation and the daily walk. We need to understand how that faith operated at salvation to appreciate how we walk now. The transformation of the spirit of our mind and our consciousness happens by this principle of faith.
