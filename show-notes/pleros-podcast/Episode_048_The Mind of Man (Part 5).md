Welcome to the Pleros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today.

Welcome back to the Pleros podcast; this is your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. We've been looking at the mind of man recently, and we must remind ourselves that God's purpose is sonship. I trust that you are walking daily in fellowship with our Father and pursuing the natural and spiritual assignments He has given to us.

## Pursuing Maximum Productivity in God's Purpose

At the core of the roadmap for our purpose is the need for maximum productivity. You need to be maximally productive and give your all, spending all the time required for each assignment. Don't just let the time pass you by or be found merely marking presence; you must do the real thing.

I say this because many things in God's word are described like a seed. If you are not attending to what you're meant to do, everything else within what the Lord wants for you will not be seen. While you have the freedom to desire comfort in your natural assignment, you do not have the choice to be unproductive.

Success is found in being entirely faithful in doing what you are doing as given to you by the Lord. If you are truly faithful, I expect that you are going to make progress. The path of the just is like a shining light that shines brighter and brighter unto the perfect day, meaning you keep walking more and more in the life of God.

## Spiritual Perfection and the Necessity of Growth

Even when we have the roadmap of purpose, we need to know how we fulfill it, which is by growth. That growth happens in our mind, as our spirits cannot actually be improved upon. Your spirit is already in a complete, perfect, and divine state, as we see in Colossians 2:10 and 2 Peter 1:4.

You have to recognize and appreciate the privilege that your spirit is already just like God's spirit. We are one spirit with the Lord, as 1 Corinthians 6:17 and Romans 8:16 confirm. If our spirits are all the same, we must ask why different believers experience such different results and outcomes in their lives.

The concern on our hearts should be the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. We are supposed to walk just like Jesus because our spirit is just like His. The only reason there may be any difference in our walk is the current state of our mind.

## The Revelation of the Inward and Outward Man

Before we go on, I want us to look at 2 Corinthians 4:16. The scripture describes us holistically as spirit, soul, and body, but Paul adds a specific distinction here. He says that even though our outward man is perishing, our inward man is being renewed day by day.

The revelation that man is a spirit is something we accept in the truth of Christ, but it can also be defended rationally. We have a physical part of us that thinks relative to the physical world, much like other creatures. However, it is only with man that we uniquely find metaphysical reasoning.

Animals display natural reasoning, but there is no concrete proof of them engaging in metaphysical thought. The proof of the metaphysical nature of man is that we use language to ask questions that go beyond the physical. We ask why we are here and how these natural things came to be, which points to a metaphysical reality.

## Understanding Man as a Dual Reality

In 2 Corinthians 4:16, Paul describes man as having a dual reality: the outward man and the inward man. One is perishing, while the other is staying unchanging and being renewed second by second. He later calls the outward man a "tent," implying the inward man is the real deal dwelling within.

The core of our humanity is spiritual, and the spirit of the believer has been entirely changed. This distinction explains why you might not notice a physical change when you get saved. Your body and mind may retain old tendencies, but your inward man is a completely new creation.

We should no longer regard or define anyone according to the flesh or the outward man. Instead, we must understand that the outward man has a body with a brain, while the inward man is a spirit with a mind. This parallel is essential to spiritual growth and fulfilling God's purpose for our lives.
