# The Pursuit of God's Purpose (Part 1)

Welcome to Plaro's podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Brothers and sisters, welcome to another episode of Plarus podcast. This is your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. Now, we're moving on to some further studies within God's purpose. We have seen from our studies the place of the gospel in our life where we saw that the gospel holds the place of truth in our lives. 

From seeing that place of truth that the gospel is, we saw the reality of God, the reality of redemption, and the reality of the new creation as a result of redemption. Having resolved the primary questions about life and our existence, we see that God made it, and it is this way because something has gone wrong which He has delivered us from. Being delivered from that, we are now new creations who receive the consummation of this reality at His coming.

## The Transition to Pursuing God's Purpose

The next thing we delved into examining is the reality of God's purpose. That took a bit of time, having to unpack everything that the scripture says about God's purpose. Now, having resolved that, even though I'm going to do a recap, we want to take it a step further. We will be looking at what we call pursuing God's purpose. 

Let's just remind ourselves: what have we seen to be God's purpose in a very objective way? The reason why I say that is because there's the possibility of thinking about God's purpose in a subjective manner. We have seen this happen in two ways generally. One subjective way people talk about God's purpose is, "God spoke to me that this is what He wants me to do." 

It's not always wrong when people say that, but there are times it just is. It's just that they are stating the subjective without having stated the objective first. Whenever they speak that way, it leads the hearers to think they also need to find out God's purpose for themselves. They think they need to take out time to pray to eventually figure it out, but that's not how it works in God's word. 

## Objective Truth vs. Subjective Experience

In God's word, God directly answers that question of purpose for us so that we are left without any confusion about what He wants us to do. When we get to the subjective part, we are even more confident to see it fit with what He has already told us in His word. We'll see it build upon that in a way that gives us comfort that we're on the right track. 

There's another way people speak subjectively about God's purpose, which is common with preachers who talk about purpose without answering directly from God's word. This is a challenge because when you are preaching God's word, you have to answer the reality of God and the necessity of redemption. There is the constant question of meaning and purpose that every person, philosophy, and religion has to answer. 

Humanity is wired as rational agents with the question of truth, and that includes the question of why or purpose. When preachers don't have that direct objective answer from God's word, we start to see people fill in the gaps. Sometimes people will go to the Great Commission and call that God's purpose. They say, "Go therefore and make disciples," is what our purpose is as believers. 

## The Eternal Foundation of Sonship

While people are well-intentioned and sincere about this, there is a mistake we are making. The purpose that God has preceded the fact that sin happened, and what Jesus was telling us to do was in light of the reality of sin. When we speak that way, we are missing the point because the very mission of the church is the restoration of man back into God's purpose. 

The mission of the church is now part of God's purpose, which is part of our spiritual assignment. By design, God always wanted us to have a spiritual assignment, but within this redemptive age, that assignment is now the redemption of humanity out of sin and darkness. Invariably, that Great Commission is subsumed into God's purpose. When we say things like that, we are not giving people a full picture. 

We must ask: what is God's eternal purpose? As Paul said in Ephesians 3:11, he called it His eternal purpose. We have seen the answer to that, and that is Sonship. I want us to have that picture so we don't just mix what we are saying into the bag of many things we already believe, but rather we are able to situate each one rightly.

## Understanding Our Spiritual and Natural Assignments

You are able to situate the Great Commission as your spiritual assignment in God's purpose. You are able to situate your personal revelation as where what He has told you personally fits in. You are able to walk with objective confidence directly from the word of God. This is the major intent in the point I'm trying to clarify. 

We have seen that what God tells us in His word His purpose is Sonship. Ephesians 1:5 shows that the good pleasure of God's will is Sonship, and Romans 8 explains what that is. Sonship is not adoption in the way we usually think; it is a positioning issue. The real deal in Sonship is being God's child and God's heir. 

We have seen God's purpose is Sonship, which means God made us because He wants us to fellowship with Him. Just times of fellowship is fulfilling purpose. I know sometimes we put a lot of attention in the pursuit part of the equation, but the fact that you are just God's child means you are walking in purpose. You are walking with God, and that's His will. 

## Cultivating a Word-Based Conviction

On the pursuit side of the equation, you are not just living as present but as one going after an assignment to do. You are wired for fulfillment, achievement, and accomplishment. It's just of God that it is like that; it's existential. It is not demonic or fleshly, and that's why we see the Lord Jesus and Paul himself having that same outlook. 

We are heirs of God, which means He has things that He owns and He allots to us to co-own with Him and to manage. In that sense, what God owns He gives to His children as allotted responsibilities that they are meant to then pursue and fulfill. We have assignments, and we have taken time to see from God's word that it includes both natural and spiritual assignments. 

You need a righteous conviction, a word-based conviction, that you are here for a reason. This is completely different from a general pressured worldly ambition. You need to preserve your heart because the world can put constant pressure on you to accomplish for the wrong reasons. I want you to have a clear sense that you are here as a matter of God's own orchestration with a real significance to your person.
