# How to Fulfill God's Purpose (Part 7)

Welcome to Plaro's podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Welcome to another episode of the Plus podcast where I'm still feeding you your daily dose of God's word, helping you to fulfill God's purpose. Today we are looking at how to fulfill God's purpose. You recall that we have already seen the reality of God's purpose and the pursuit or the journey of that purpose. We've seen that God's purpose for our life is sonship, which means to be God's child and to be God's heir.

## The Foundation of Sonship and Divine Assignment

Why we exist is because God wants us to be in his family, fellowshipping with him, walking in devotion towards him, and growing in our nature and character. That is a foundational part of God's purpose; we are functioning as children of God walking with him. But as his child, he also gives us responsibilities, which means we are heirs of God. We could call those responsibilities inheritance—things that he owns that he assigns to us to do or manage for him.

We could call them assignments because the word means a lot that is assigned to you. When you say an inheritance, it is a lot assigned, and an heir is one who is assigned a lot. So there is that which the Lord has given to us to do to fulfill in his purpose for our life. There are assignments he has given to us to do in his purpose for our life.

How do we fulfill his purpose? We see it very clearly from the words of the Lord Jesus when he had accomplished the work of redemption, which is a restoration back into his purpose. The instruction he gave the disciples is not only for people to be saved and found in his purpose, but for them to be discipled to fulfill that purpose. They are not only to be saved; they are to be discipled to fulfill that purpose that God has for them.

## The Necessity of Preparation and Discipleship

In saying that, the Lord is saying that the way these people will be able to walk as I want them to—to walk in love, to walk as children of their father, and to do the assignments I have for them—is through discipleship. You remember the other text we looked at as well, which is Luke 12:47-48. The Lord Jesus said, "He that knows his master's will and does not prepare and do according to his will be beaten with many stripes."

Knowing his will is not enough. It's important that you know his will because the very next verse says if you do not know his will and yet you did things deserving of stripes, you'll be beaten with few stripes. So knowing the will of God is key. You don't escape the responsibility to find out what God's purpose for your life is, but then even if you know the will of God, there is the responsibility to prepare and do.

Many times we want to jump from knowing the will of God to doing it, and that's a sure way to fail at doing God's purpose. Anyone that tries to jump from knowing the assignment to just doing it without preparation will likely do it out of the flesh or fail at doing it at all. I don't mean you stop your life to prepare to do God's will; it's going to happen alongside what you're doing, but you must commit yourself to the preparation.

One thing is sure: our discipleship is lifelong. Preparation may be foundational for a phase, but it is ongoing notwithstanding. It's like the phase when a child is born where there is intense preparation through primary, secondary, and tertiary institutions. There is that early phase of rigorous training where you get some expertise, but that shouldn't be the end of learning; you have simply finished the foundational phase and are now in an ongoing phase of learning.

## The Goal of the Fivefold Ministry

The same is true spiritually, even of plants. You plant the seed, and there is a phase where you see no fruit because it is just a preparatory phase. Eventually, you start to bear fruit, but that doesn't mean the tree stops receiving sunlight or nutrients from the soil. It can't fruit until it has gotten to a phase of growth and development before the continuous sustenance that it needs.

There is really a foundational phase of growth for the believer, just as there is an ongoing preparation, learning, and training that still happens. You don't have to stop your life to do it, but you need to be intentional about being prepared to do the will of God. If you do not receive preparation, you are either going to do it out of the flesh or fail at it altogether. You need to be prepared to function as his heir and as his child.

In that light, we have been looking at what exactly this training entails. Paul's explanation in Ephesians 4:11-16 has been quite eye-opening on that matter. He explains that when the Lord ascended, he gave gifts to men: apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. Why were they given? He says for the perfecting of the saints, which is a word the Lord used in Luke 6:40 to talk about discipleship.

## Renewing the Mind in Christ

Paul chooses a word that is more explanatory. While discipleship speaks to the relationship of teaching, the word "perfecting" (katismos) means bringing someone to an end or a goal. As the Lord said, a disciple is not more than his master, but he that is perfectly trained will be as his master. There is a goal in mind: the unity of the faith, the knowledge of the Son of God, and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.

All these descriptions are reflective of how our Lord was in his earthly work, so that we can get to the point where we are like him in growth. I understand we’ll never be sinless, but he's not cutting us that much slack. He's not saying just be at any point in growth that you like. How are you going to fulfill God's purpose if you fall short of the growth you should have? You should be able to do all that the Lord wants you to do.

This growth we are meant to have is a growth in our mind. We are not to walk as the rest of the Gentiles do, who walk in the futility of their mind with their understanding darkened. They are alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance and blindness of their heart. What is lacking on their mind is the truth, as verse 21 says: "as the truth is in Jesus."

## Translating Knowledge into Spiritual Growth

There is an emphasis in the scope of doctrine, and that emphasis is who we are in Christ. Verse 22 says the truth is that you should put off the old man and be renewed in the spirit of your mind. Put on the new man which is created after God in righteousness and holiness of truth. The central truth lacking in anyone walking in a worldly manner is the reality of who they are in Christ.

If we go to Ephesians 4:13, the end goal of all the knowledge of God's word is this confident and assured recognition of who we are in Christ. He wants us to know precisely and perfectly who we are. If you are going to fulfill God's purpose, you need growth, and that growth is by knowledge primarily that will produce a stature. But then, does knowledge equal growth immediately?

The answer is no. It takes the knowledge of the new creation to grow, but knowing who you are is not automatically equal to growth. When you learn you are a new man, your walk is not immediately guaranteed by that knowledge. There is what we do that gives us the structure of the knowledge we have. What exactly brings about the growth of the believer? We’re going to see how exactly we do that in the next episode. Catch you on that one.
