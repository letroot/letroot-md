# Introduction and the Foundation of Purpose

Welcome to the Pleros podcast, a daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. We have previously explored the place of the gospel as the place of truth and the reality of God's purpose. Now, we are settling into a new subject: the pursuit of God's purpose. Now that we know why we are here and what God made us for, we must ask ourselves what we are supposed to do next.

The answer is not found in general natural wisdom; instead, we can trust God's word to give us objective direction. In the last episode, I emphasized the void of meaning and purpose with which we are existentially designed. We must ensure that God truly fills that void, rather than allowing it to be filled by the pressures of life or the cares of the world.

## Guarding the Heart Against Natural Ambition

Many times, when people talk about greatness, success, or fulfillment, their words are tailored to the natural human desire for achievement. This aspiration is often driven by competition or the basic need for survival once you have crossed the line of meeting your needs. However, you must be careful that this is not how you function as a believer.

Once you have the revelation of God's purpose and sonship, your heart must be rooted in it. You must recognize that the reason you were born, the reason you have breath, and the reason you exist is for this specific purpose. God made you for sonship, and you should be grateful that through faith in Christ, you have become a son of God.

## The Significance of Your Unique Allotment

While we are all children and heirs of God, we also have "severed" inheritances, meaning we have individual assignments. Each person is significant in God's plan, and what has been allotted to you is unique to you. There is literally nobody else who has been given exactly what you have been allotted by God.

A powerful example of this in scripture is the relationship between Saul and David. What was allotted to Saul was originally meant for him, but because of his unfaithfulness and disobedience, that kingdom was eventually taken away and given to another. This shows us that while God has a plan, our faithfulness determines whether we walk in the lot that was rightfully ours.

## Embracing Your Exclusive Assignment

Whatever God has allotted to someone is strictly for them, and this means you are just as special as those you look up to. What another person has belongs to them, and what God has given to you is yours alone. Your assignment does not affect theirs, and theirs does not affect yours; you are that significant in the equation of what God is doing on earth.

You must place a sense of significance on yourself and recognize that your portion is not given to multiple people to see who finishes first. It is given to you to do, and if you do not do it, it does not get done in the ordinary sense. While God may find another way through His orchestration, you must embrace the clear sense of your specific place in existence.

## Beginning the Walk Where You Are

In 1 Corinthians 7:17, the scripture says, "As God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk." This highlights the individual nature of our assignments and the specific parts we play in the whole. The word "distributed" or "parted" implies that there is a larger plan, but God has given you a specific measure to carry out.

Your walk in God’s purpose begins exactly where you are right now. You do not need to wait for special events or for a specific set of circumstances to be fulfilled. Whether you were called in one state or another, you can begin your fellowship and assignment immediately. Start where you are, knowing that you have the right to make progress as you pursue His call.
