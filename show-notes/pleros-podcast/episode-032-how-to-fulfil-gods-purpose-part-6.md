## Understanding Our Inheritance as Sons

Romans 8:15-17 makes it clear that we have received the spirit of sonship, which is often called adoption. While "adoption" refers to the position we occupy, we are natural children of God. That is why the Spirit gives witness or evidence that we are children of God and heirs of God. When you are a son of God, it is not a matter of gender. 

Being a son of God means you are a child of God who happens also to be an heir. Galatians 3:26 says we are all sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus, meaning we are children who are heirs by faith. When you say God's purpose for your life is sonship, you are saying that God has made you to be His child. You are meant to be in fellowship with Him, to walk in His nature, and to partake in regular devotion. 

The second part of sonship is being God’s heir, which brings us to the assignment part of the equation. God owns things and allots them to people to fulfill His purposes. While Romans 8 says we have a joint inheritance in all of creation, the scriptures also make clear the reality of individual assignments. Each and every one of us has individual assignments given to us by God. 

## The Process of Spiritual Perfecting

As 1 Corinthians 7:17 says, "as God has distributed to each one, as God has called each one, so let him walk." This distribution involves both a natural assignment and a spiritual assignment. Even if you know the journey of God’s purpose, you need to know what it takes to actually get it done. You can know the process, but you must ask if you are even able to do it. 

I use the example of someone told to carry two bags of cement; you need the growth required to be able to fulfill that assignment. You must reach specific points in strength and endurance to do what you are meant to do. That is precisely how it is when we talk about fulfilling God’s purpose. There is a required stature and growth that makes it possible. 

The Lord Jesus was aware of this, which is why he told the apostles to disciple people so they could walk in all He commanded. That discipleship is what Paul explains in Ephesians 4:12 as the "perfecting of the saints." You need to be perfected as a saint to be able to do God’s purpose for your life. Ephesians 4 makes clear the exact point we need to get to in this training. 

## The Goal of Maturity and Knowledge

Ephesians 4:13 says "till we all come to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God." In verse 12, Paul mentions that the leaders of the church are given for the "perfecting" of the saints, using the Greek word *katismos*. This means to bring something to a completion point or an end. The leaders of the church are to bring you to a destination of spiritual completion. 

The goal includes the unity of the faith, the knowledge of the Son of God, the perfect man, and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. These four descriptions fall into two categories, with the first two focusing on knowledge. Unity of the faith refers to the wholesomeness and entirety of the message we have believed. It is not necessarily about the agreement of different denominations. 

While unity of the spirit refers to recognizing we share the same spirit regardless of race or gender, unity of the faith is about the message itself. Arriving at the unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son of God is a prerequisite to growth. However, knowledge alone is not growth; something must be done with that knowledge to make for true maturity. Without this knowledge, you cannot have the growth you are supposed to have.

## Renewing the Mind for God's Purpose

We fulfill God’s purpose depending on the state of our mind. Everything said in Ephesians 4:13 regarding the "perfect man" and the "stature of Christ" relates to the mind. In verses 17 to 19, Paul emphasizes that we should not walk as the Gentiles do. They walk the way they do because of the "futility of their mind" and because their "understanding is darkened." 

Even if your nature is changed as a believer, if your mind remains the same, your walk will be just like theirs. There is your nature, your mind, and then your walk. While you have the life of God in your spirit, your mind might still be darkened or empty of truth. The Lord has given the church to teach and groom you, giving you the mind that helps you fulfill God’s purpose. 

You have not "so learned Christ" if you are lacking these things or acting like those without the life of God. To learn Christ is to be taught "as the truth is in Jesus." This truth transcends just the way of salvation; it concerns our daily walk and life. The leaders of the church speak this truth in love so that you can grow into Christ. 

## Putting on the New Man

The main thing on your mind that needs to change is what you think about yourself. Verse 22 says to "put off concerning your former conversation the old man," which grows corrupt according to deceitful lusts. You must be renewed in the spirit of your mind and "put on the new man." This is the core truth meant to be on our mind: the truth about who we are. 

The new man is created after God in righteousness and holiness of truth. You are no longer that old man alienated from the life of God; you are a new man having the very righteousness and holiness of God. When you understand this identity, you can walk in the reality of who you truly are. We are reaching a high point on this issue of how we fulfill God's purpose, and it all centers on the state of your mind.
