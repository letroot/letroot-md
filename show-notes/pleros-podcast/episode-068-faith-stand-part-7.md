# Faith Stand (Part 7)

## Introduction: The Purpose of the Gospel
Welcome to Pleroma Podcasts. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akin. It is going to be an enlightened time in God's Word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's Word, taught to be. Let's get right into it.

Welcome back to the Pleroma Podcasts. This is your Daily Dose of God's Word. It tries for me to fulfill God's purpose for your life. Every time we are trying to remind you what God's purpose is and equip you with what you need in the knowledge of God's Word, to be able to fulfill all that the Lord wants you to do.

## Recap: Spiritual Growth and the Mind
We have come a long way. We are presently looking at the subject matter, "Faith Stand," and we are doing that on the back of studying things that we have already said to the Lord God's purpose. We have seen that it takes our mind to grow, to be able to fulfill God's purpose and we are then seeing what particularly makes our mind grow and what particular area of our mind grows to fulfill God's purpose.

Okay, so a brief recap. We know God's purpose is sonship. He has called us to be child and is here as this he has just given us assignments to fulfill. Now we have the other part which is we need to grow mature, be disciples, to be able to fulfill God's purpose which means to walk as his child and to fulfill the assignments we have as his heirs.

But then we saw that when we speak about spiritual growth, we are not talking about the growth, development, or improvement of our spirits. And that's because our spirit is already in the complete, perfect, and divine state. So spiritual growth rather refers to what happens to our mind. And that led us to study the subject matter of the mind a whole lot more.

## The Seven Aspects of the Mind
You recall the several things we saw about the mind, particularly the seven aspects of the mind where we saw that there's the reasoning part of man's mind. Then there is the memory, there's the will or free will, there's the will that man has, and then there is conviction. There is reckoning or consciousness before we then speak about emotions and conscience judgments. So these seven aspects of the human mind are very important for us to appreciate. They are very important for us to appreciate how we grew and then walk as believers.

## Reckoning vs. Reasoning and Conviction
Now recall that what we reason or think about is not the state of our growth. Our reason is not reflective of the state of our growth. So you could be considering something in your reason, but it is not yet your conviction led along your growth. Now we also saw that your conviction does not tell us the state of your growth. You could agree with the particular truth, but what you reckon is something different or aside that truth.

And this is why it's so important for us to point out that when we speak about the growth of any individual, we are particularly focused on a part of the mind, the consciousness or the reckoning part of the mind. And what really tells us the state of your growth or maturity as a believer is the reckoning part of your mind. How mature, how developed, how strong are you in your consciousness of certain things as a believer?

Before I proceed, let me use an example here that I've used maybe a number of times already, but as you love, you could know that you are a love being in Christ as a believer, but your reckoning or your consciousness of you being a love being may be weak. And that could be for many different reasons. Maybe you grew up in a contentious home or you at the time maybe outside of home, maybe boarding school or something to that effect where you were around contentious people and you just have this tendency to see contention in every situation, to suspect everybody as someone to have an issue with. And then you are always on the edge of yourself expecting strife in different ways.

Now, the fact that you know that you are a love being in Christ is not equal to your growth, your maturity is not equal to the strength of reckoning or the strength of consciousness that you have about you being a love being. So it's one thing to have that enlightenment is another thing to have that growth development or transformation, which that is a matter of consciousness.

## Transformation by Faith Stand
Now, the reason for emphasizing all this is so that you can fulfill God's purpose. Remember, we said this is your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. That is without the transformation happening, the fulfillment of God's purpose for your life is unlikely. So if we can recognize that our existence and the reason for the Christian faith hinges and centers upon the reality of God's purpose, then we can appreciate why God gave the church and brought us to be discipled as saints. It's all for the sake of why he made us in the first place.

So with this in mind, knowing why God made you and knowing that it takes this transformation to fulfill it, how does this transformation happen? Now, that's what took us to the story of faith. We said that this transformation that happens to us happens by "Faith Stand."

Now, the reason we are making this distinction using this term, Faith Stand, different from simply saying faith is because it's not just the act of... it's not just a single act of faith or a single instance of believing that we are speaking to. We are speaking to a much long-term continuous, sometimes unending, stance of faith that we are meant to have for the rest of our lives.

## Biblical Examples of Standing in Faith
We saw that from many texts already. Remember, Romans 6 showed us that the fact that we know that we are new creations is not equal to our reckoning of it. So he told the folks who already know in Romans 6. He says, you know this, you know that, you know... in this place has reckoned yourself to be dead indeed to sin. And we'll go on to repeat the same instruction with another word. He says, present yourself. So you reckon yourself and you present yourself. You reckon that you are dead to sin. You are alive to God. You have the life of God in you. You know, you are reckoning that. You are presenting that about yourself.

Another text in this regard that we looked at was James 1, but I don't want to go so deep into it. He says, the reason why one can be a hearer and not a doer is that, having heard, they are still deceiving themselves or they are mis-recognizing themselves. So they have the knowledge and the conviction, but they are forgetful. And this is not forgetfulness in terms of inability to draw it out of their memory, but forgetfulness in terms of it is not the state of their consciousness or their reckoning.

And we're talking about the passive consciousness. That is not what you are actively, you know, aware of all the time, but it is not their sort that is their natural reaction. You know, a loving person is a sweet person. Even when someone does something wrong, before their immediate reaction, maybe it would be something, maybe it ought to be something harsh... It's first going to be something concerning what happened, right? Because that's what is on their hearts. That's what they have trained themselves to be. But then for someone who is already predisposed to be harsh, they will react harshly just immediately.

And we are seeing that God expects us to renew our minds, to retrain our hearts, to align with the nature that we already have. So your spirit is 100% like Christ. Is that it is joined to the Lord is one spirit with him. But your mind, particularly its consciousness, part of your mind may not be like Christ. You know the funny part, your reasoning can be like Christ. You are already thinking like him; your conviction can be like Christ, which is exactly what the church should give to you.

Ephesians chapter 4 and in verse 13. We all are meant to be brought to the unity of the faith, knowledge of the Son of God. So now you're thinking of yourself as a Son of God unlike the Son of God does. So your conviction is exactly right. But your growth is really about your reckoning or about your consciousness. And that's a matter of faith stand. Because that what you reckon—*logizomai*—is to take into account. And it's a continuous act of taking into account.

Right. I've given the example before when I count the reality of the inventory in this store is what you account for. The reality of the transactions that took place is what you account for. You don't account for what you want to happen. You account for what the reality is. So we are told to reckon ourselves dead to sin because that's the reality we have to *logizomai* ourselves. We have to reckon ourselves.

## Presenting Ourselves as a Living Sacrifice
And now I just want to jump because I want us to make some real progress. We have looked at this issue of faith stand from many texts. We have, you know, when we saw that word, Reckon, we also saw the word present. Present is *paristemi*. You remember that there are two words there. And it simply means to stand beside, right? *Para* means beside; *histemi* means to stand. So you have to present yourself to stand beside yourself.

I hope you recall as well that Romans chapter 12 and verse 1 uses this word to present. Romans chapter 12 says, I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy acceptable to God, which is your reasonable worship. And that shows us that this act of presenting is meant to be defining our life of prayer, our life of worship. Notice it says your reasonable worship and uses that word *Latria*, which is used for regular temple worship and believers now collectively make up the temple of God individually. We are the temple of the Holy Ghost. So with that recognition that we are the temple of God, we also have a consistent *Latria*, a consistent life and pattern of worship that is supposed to affect all that we do.

Okay, with all of this in mind, we have seen that that presenting/reckoning is by faith. Second Corinthians 1:24 says by faith, you stand. First Thessalonians chapter 3. It says, now we are glad if you stand fast in the Lord. And if you read the preceding verses, you find out I was talking about their faith. So their faith is their standing, their standing fast.

So this type of faith is not like salvation. Nobody says salvation is a standing. Salvation, you are not standing. Salvation you are receiving is once and for all. And that's why I almost make that distinction between the faith and salvation, which simply receives in one instance, and the faith that makes for our walk, which is a matter of a stand of faith.

## Standing in the Gospel
Let me show you another text that makes this clearer. First Corinthians 15, it shows us that the gospel is not just for our believing for salvation is for our continuous stand in view of our walk. First Corinthians 15, and the verse one says, moreover brethren I declare to you the gospel, which I preach to you, which also you received and in which you stand. I hope you notice that I said I preach the gospel to you. You received this and in it you stand. So it's not enough that at salvation, you believed, you made that act of faith and you believe the gospel. It's important that following from salvation, you are standing, you know, you are standing in God's Word.

And that act of standing can also be called Holding Fast, verse two, say, by which you are saved, if you hold fast the word which was preached to you, unless you believed in vain. So we see that there's a continuing act that follows from salvation, there is a standing, there is the holding fast that is naturally what makes for the walk of the believer after salvation. And all of this is faith.

## Agreeing vs. Accepting Truth
We have looked at the principle of faith, faith is of the heart and the mouth. And we said two things happen on the heart of man in faith. The first is you agree with the truth. The second is you accept it for yourself. The reason why this is important is the nature of the truth we are talking about is something that must be received. You could possibly agree with a truth and not receive it or accept it about yourself.

Let me use an example. Let's say you agree and you know that you are a human being. That's the truth. But you don't accept that you are human... then we have a problem there. So you could agree with the truth that the truth is on its own independent of you. There's another thing for it to be personalized to you. You are a human being. That's very important. If you have the recognition of a human being or a male or whatever one it is, we are seeing that faith must not just agree with truth, faith accepts truth for oneself.

Let's use an example. You could agree that Jesus died and rose again and not accept it for yourself. That what he has done is efficacious to you. You even hear people say, "Well, he did it for you... certain people are not for me." That's the problem. If indeed they do believe that he did it and they are not accepting it for themselves, they would be like the demons that agree that there is God. It says they do agree and they tremble, but the agreement is not to the end of accepting his relationship, his logic over themselves. So it must be personalized. That's what happens on the heart.

## Persistence in Faith
Now, but we talked about the mouth. Very important part of its time. So with the mouth, you are affirming that which you have accepted. And at salvation, then you become saved. Well, in this case, when you accept who you are in Christ, you are affirming it, which we are seeing happens in prayer. When you accept who you are in Christ, you are strengthening your consciousness or your reckoning of who you are, which transforms you to walk. So that change is happening on this reckoning part of you and it transforms his work.

Now, what we want to get to on a study of faith stand is one more issue in the principle of faith, which is the issue of persistence. The persistence of faith is a core issue in the principle of faith and is a core issue in prayer, which is in strange things. We are told that this faith stands happens in prayer. So it's not strange that this act of persistence happens in faith as well as in prayer. And if you do not understand it, you are not going to have an effective walk of faith. We have people whose attitude in faith is, "I'm going to try it out." And that attitude is completely not the idea that we find from God's word ought to be when one is walking in faith.

So we are going to get to that in the next episode. And with that, we'll start to hang down on our study on faith and prepare for another subject matter. So see you on the next one. We'll be looking more at the issue of the persistence of faith. See you then.
