# How to Fulfill God's Purpose (Part 1)

Welcome to Pleros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Welcome to the Pleros podcast. We give you your daily dose of God's word to transform your life to fulfill God's purpose. I believe that you've been blessed if you have been following because today we are switching on to another topic, but within the same line of what we have been examining. Now, if you remember, we started out by looking at the place of the gospel in our lives, which is that the gospel is the truth. 

And then we moved on from there and saw the reality of God's purpose. We didn't just see the truth about the world, why it's the way it is, and how we are saved from the contradiction in the world, but we had to answer this important question of purpose. Why are we here? What's the reason that we exist, and what's the reason for our lives? In answering the question of purpose, we saw from Ephesians 1:5 and 9 that God's purpose is sonship. 

Sonship means to be God's child and God's heir. Being the child of God means that you have His nature, His life, and His character, which is a call to fellowship with Him. This fellowship strengthens us to walk in that nature and character that is of Him. But then there is the other part of the equation when we speak about God's purpose: we are heirs of God. As heirs, we have certain assignments given to us, divided into a natural assignment and a spiritual assignment.

## Pursuing Our Natural and Spiritual Assignments

The next thing we had to resolve was how we carry out these assignments in God's purpose. For our natural assignment, we saw five critical things involved in this pursuit. We start where we are, take advantage of opportunities, and use the world as we desire without misusing it. Additionally, we must remain open to the leading of the Spirit across everything we do and remain maximally productive.

For our spiritual assignment, we also identified five things. I realized that in the last episode I made a mistake on the fifth one, so I will correct it today. Previously, I said we keep growing until discipleship, but I meant to say we keep growing onto leadership. The steps are: you commit to discipleship in the local church, you go out to reach people, you preach and publicize the gospel, you disciple those who receive the message, and finally, you grow into leadership.

Every believer is meant to grow into leadership as part of God's purpose. In 1 Timothy, it says if any man desires the office of a bishop, he desires a good work. The word bishop simply means a leader or an overseer. While our modern world often ranks a bishop higher than a pastor, in the mindset of the scriptures, these roles—bishop, pastor, and elder—refer to the same general responsibility of oversight and leadership.

## The Cycle of Participation in the Church

It is the reasoning of the scriptures that we all, as we carry out our spiritual assignments, are meant to grow into leadership. We see this in the New Testament where people like Philemon and others in Romans 16 were leading churches in their houses. These individuals were taking responsibility and were not just consumers; they were active participants in the mission of the Lord Jesus.

A church was not designed for people to just consume, like a customer buying a product. If you take a product like Coca-Cola, you are simply consuming it for your own good, and the product demands nothing more of you. However, that is not the way it is with the gospel. While you receive the gospel as a consumer onto salvation and growth, that effect is meant to translate into your participation and commitment to the gospel.

This vision is reflected in Ephesians 4, where it says each of us has grace according to the measure of Christ's gift. He gave leaders—apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers—for the perfecting of the saints. By the time you get to verse 16, the saints who are perfected are expected to function in that same responsibility of leadership towards others. There is a cycle of leadership meant to be happening in the church.

## Preparation as the Key to Fulfillment

Now we look at how to fulfill God's purpose. You might ask what the difference is between "pursuing" and "fulfilling" purpose. The pursuit describes the journey and how the purpose plays out from start to finish. You can end up like Gaius, Erastus, or Onesimus, who all had different starting points but faithfully served the church. However, the journey itself requires that you are capable of carrying it out.

Let's use an example of someone whose purpose is to carry two heavy bags of cement for 500 meters. To succeed, you have to prepare. You must go to the gym and decide how strong you need to be to reach that point without dropping the bags. This preparation is what makes the fulfillment of the purpose possible. Knowing the journey without being prepared makes for a very difficult path.

This is the introduction to how to fulfill God's purpose, based on Luke 12:47, which speaks of the one who knows the will but does not prepare. In the next episode, we will start to see exactly what makes it possible for us to fulfill God's purpose. We trust you were blessed by today's episode.
