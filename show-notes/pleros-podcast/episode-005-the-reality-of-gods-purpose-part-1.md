# The Reality of God's Purpose (Part 1)

We have been exploring key aspects of the gospel's role in our lives. The gospel asserts itself as the foundational truth for every individual, not through imposition, but by demonstrating its veracity. We have seen this proven in several areas, including the reality of God through observation, the necessity of redemption, and the reality of the new creation.

Previously, we identified five core claims of truth within the gospel that we must comprehend. We have covered three of these. Now, we delve into the fourth, which opens a new realm of study: the reality of God's purpose. Understanding this fundamental aspect is central to the gospel message.

Our starting point is Ephesians chapter 1, the same chapter that introduced our earlier study. Paul states that we believed in Jesus after hearing "the word of truth, which is the gospel of our salvation." Before making this statement, he highlighted many crucial elements that constitute the truth of the gospel. Among the primary revelations of the gospel, Paul emphasizes the subject of purpose.

Before proceeding, let's address a critical distinction. We have established that truth is generally verifiable through observation and reason. Any claim of truth can be examined by our senses and intellect for confirmation. However, there is one category of truth that defies proof by mere observation and reason. This tension must be resolved before we explore further scriptural insights.

## The Limits of Empirical Truth

Consider the example of two people entering a room and seeing someone fully covered on a bed. They might wonder what is there. One person moves closer and confirms it is a human being. Through observation, they have answered the truth question: "What's that on the bed?"

They can continue to ask other questions about that individual, even while they sleep. One could take a blood sample to determine their genotype or medical history. With the right systems, one might even ascertain their name or social security number. Their height and weight can be determined without ever needing to wake them or speak to them.

Despite the vast amount of information that can be gathered about an individual without direct communication, one question remains unanswerable: What is this person trying to accomplish? We cannot discern someone's intentions or purpose unless that person reveals it. This "why" question represents a genuine truth, yet it remains inherently hidden from external scrutiny. This is a unique domain of truth, exclusively accessible through revelation.

## The Necessity of Divine Revelation

This principle has profound implications. Even if we understand God's creation of the world or the necessity of redemption through Jesus Christ, and even if we recognize ourselves as new creations—all essential truths—the overarching question persists: Why are we here? This singular question cannot be resolved by observation and reason alone; it requires divine revelation.

This is precisely what Paul conveys in Ephesians chapter 1. In verse 9, he declares that "God has made known to us the mystery of His will." He had previously explained that our redemption through Christ was orchestrated by God's wisdom and prudence. This occurred, he clarifies, because God first revealed this mystery to us.

The term "mystery" in biblical context often carries a different connotation than its common usage. It does not refer to esoteric information reserved for a select few, but rather to information that simply *requires* revelation. Paul asserts that God's will necessitates revelation to be understood. Just as we cannot know another person's will unless they communicate it, we cannot know God's will unless He makes it known to us.

## Unveiling the Mystery of God's Will

The text continues, stating that God "has made known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure which He proposed in Himself." This statement is rich with meaning. Paul links God's will, His good pleasure, and His purpose. The phrase "according to His good pleasure" indicates that God's good pleasure precedes and informs His will.

The Greek word for "good pleasure" is *eudokia*, which denotes what someone simply likes, or what seems good to them. Paul explains that God's desires stem from what He inherently likes. God's purpose was not imposed upon Him by external pressure; it emerged purely from His inherent disposition and became His intention and determination.

In this context, God's purpose, His good pleasure, and His will are intrinsically linked and can be used interchangeably. Paul explicitly defines this purpose in earlier verses. Ephesians 1:5 states, "He predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself." This act of predestination occurred "according to the good pleasure of His will."

Therefore, whatever the predestination was "onto" must be the good pleasure of His will. We can conclude that God’s will, good pleasure, and ultimate purpose is sonship. This concept of sonship will be explored in greater detail in the subsequent episode.
