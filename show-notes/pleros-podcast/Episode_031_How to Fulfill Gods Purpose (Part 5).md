# How to Fulfill God's Purpose (Part 5)

Welcome to the Pleros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Welcome back to the Pleros podcast; this is your daily dose of God's word, transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. We've come a long way and have seen a couple of things as we make further progress in our studies centered upon God's purpose. We are now at the core where we are looking at the "transforming you" part to fulfill that purpose. I believe we have done enough to help you see what God's purpose is through the direct revelation of God.

## The Foundation of Divine Revelation

You know that purpose by nature is that which must be revealed; it's not something that can be known by observation and reason. You need revelation to know God's purpose, though at this juncture some people will assume the revelation needed is strictly a personal word from God. While having God speak to you personally is an important part of our walk, the primary foundational way of recognizing His purpose is His direct and general revelation to humanity. This is His open letter to us—the Bible—which is authorized by the resurrection of Jesus as the document of truth.

From the Bible, we can clearly and directly see what God's purpose is. Ephesians 1 is particularly explicit, stating in verse nine that He has made known unto us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure. Ephesians 1:5 also tells us that His good pleasure and will is what He predestined us back to, which is sonship. Knowing what sonship is, which we have studied from Romans 8:15-17, means being God's child and God's heir.

## Understanding Our Divine Inheritance

We zoomed in on the "heir" part of the equation because being God's child is foundational, but it doesn't always come with the immediate sense of fulfillment or accomplishment. The scriptures recognize the expectation of individuals fulfilling what they are meant to do. You can see this in Paul’s writing, particularly in 2 Timothy 4:6-8 where he says he has fought the good fight and finished the race. He instructed Timothy to "fulfill your ministry," showing that he himself was an example of someone who finished that which was given unto him to do.

We can understand inheritance on three levels: God's Spirit given to us, the entirety of creation as joint-heirs with Christ, and our individual assignments. This third level is where we focus on fulfilling God's purpose for your life. You must be aware of the inheritance you have, which can best be described as assignments the Lord has given to you. It's in that sense that we speak of both your natural and spiritual assignments.

One of the most important things is that we mustn't be imbalanced in our view of God's purpose. There is usually a tendency, based on our conditioning before salvation, to have certain preferences and tendencies for things we wanted to do on our own. When you are exposed to the reality of your spiritual assignments, you might start to have a battle in your mind. However, as a believer, you must know that the Spirit of God is in you and you can do all that God has called you to do.

## The Role of the Church in Spiritual Growth

Philippians 2:13 tells us that God is at work in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure. This means God is working in you to want to do your natural and spiritual assignments. You cannot say as a believer that you "don't feel like doing it" because, as a matter of your new nature, you already want to do that which is of God. When you are confronted with a contradiction in your feelings, you must speak God's word to that contradiction and admit the reality of who you are.

To fulfill our assignments, we must maintain a life of devotion and growth. It is our devotional life that strengthens us to carry the "burden" of our assignments. The very first step to doing all that God has called us to do is attaining the stature that makes it possible. We should have a dual ambition where we are trying to grow so that we can then fulfill the purpose that God has for our lives.

In Ephesians 4, Paul explains the discipleship mandate where the Lord gave the church leaders—apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastor-teachers—for the perfecting of the saints. As they perfect the saints, the saints do the work of ministry and edify the body of Christ. The word for "perfecting" is *katartismos*, which means the saints are to be brought to an end point or a destination. This destination includes coming to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God.

## Renewing the Mind for God’s Purpose

We are to be brought to an end point in knowledge as well as an end point in stature and growth. In Ephesians 4:17, Paul explains that the result of this work is that we should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk. Their walk is a product of the futility and emptiness of their minds. Their understanding is darkened because they are alienated from the life of God through ignorance and the blindness of their hearts.

Paul is showing us that the way you walk should change once you have believed the gospel because something should have been done to your mind by the church. If the church has addressed your mind, then your work is supposed to follow suit. The growth we need is something that happens on our minds rather than just in our spirits. This transformation affects the whole of our life and enables us to carry out our assignments.

From the next episode, we're going to be opening up what spiritual growth is like for us as a matter of the mind. We trust you were blessed by today's episode and encouraged to stay in faith.
