# How to Fulfill God's Purpose (Part 12)

Welcome to the Plearos podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

All right, welcome to another episode of the Plearos podcast. This is your daily dose of God's word, transforming you to fulfill God's purpose for your life. We are looking at how to fulfill God's purpose, and this will be the last episode in this specific series. We will move from here to the mind of man, which is still part of how you fulfill God's purpose, so that we can explore that subject matter better and tie it back later.

## Understanding Sonship and Growth

I believe we have already established what God's purpose is. We have seen that God's purpose is sonship, which means to be God's child and to be God's heir. As His heir, you have both a natural assignment and a spiritual assignment. We carry out this purpose through a daily life of devotion and fellowship with the Father that helps our growth and walk in His nature.

Another thing to remember from the last episode is that we fulfill God's purpose by the transformation of our minds. This happens by the renewing of our mind, even though there are many other things going on there, such as knowing, presenting, and reckoning. We must therefore study the mind of man scripturally to see how it affects our walk. For now, I will recap some key points before we dive into the book of James.

## The Necessity of Discipleship and Preparation

I hope you recall that the only way we can fulfill God's purpose is through discipleship or preparation. The Lord said to go get them saved and then disciple them, which implies that discipleship is required for us to fulfill our purpose. In Luke 12, we read that he who knows God's will but does not prepare will be beaten with many stripes. Knowing God's will is simply not enough.

There is a very critical need for preparation to be able to do God's will. If you jump the preparation phase, you will likely do it in the flesh and may even fail at it. Even if you appear to succeed, you likely walked in covetousness and idolatry rather than the Spirit. There are no shortcuts or substitutes for the continuous training found in the Word of God.

Discipleship should be seen in two ways: as foundational and as ongoing. It is just like education, where there is an early foundational stage followed by ongoing professional training and exposure. This is not even theory; it is directly stated in God's word. Peter told his disciples in Second Peter that he would not be negligent to put them in reminder of things they already knew.

## Knowledge Versus Spiritual Stature

Knowing the truth does not excuse you from a continuous reminder of that truth. Paul expressed the same thoughts when he spoke to Timothy, telling him to continue in what he had already learned and been assured of. Even in the Plearos perfecting course, our desire is to give you a framework of doctrinal understanding. However, you still need ongoing education, just as Paul, Timothy, and Peter did.

The moment you stop continuously learning God's word, you are going to walk in the flesh because the world is also giving you an ongoing education. We cannot escape the necessity of discipleship, which Paul calls the perfecting of the saints. This perfecting is meant to bring us to an end point in knowledge and in stature. We have seen the knowledge part, but knowledge alone does not make for stature.

Having knowledge is enlightenment, but it is not necessarily growth or transformation. You cannot grow if you do not know, but there is a lie that knowledge itself is the same thing as growth. You can prove this yourself by looking at your walk and seeing where it doesn't match what you know. You must find the missing link between your knowledge and your walk, which is reckoning and presenting who you are.

## Becoming a Doer Through Consciousness

In James 1:21, we are told to lay aside filthiness and receive with meekness the grafted word which is able to save our souls. James is talking to believers here about affecting our walk and our lives. He then tells us to be doers of the word and not hearers only, which prevents us from deceiving ourselves. This word "deceiving" is related to "reckoning aside" or ignoring what we have heard.

When a man is hearing the word but not doing it, he is reckoning aside the knowledge he has received. For example, you could learn that you are a love being in Christ and feel truly blessed by that truth. However, if someone offends you and you immediately walk in anger, your reckoning has not changed to match your knowledge. You are like a man observing his natural face in a mirror who then goes away and forgets what he looks like.

The man who looks into the law of liberty and continues in it is not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work. The word "continues" here means to abide beside or maintain a faith stand on what was heard. This maintenance makes you conscious of the truth, and that consciousness is what leads to doing. Ultimately, your growth is defined by your consciousness and your reckoning of who you are in Christ.
