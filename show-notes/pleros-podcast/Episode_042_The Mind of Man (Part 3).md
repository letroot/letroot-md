# The Mind of Man (Part 3)

You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Welcome to the Pleros podcast. This is your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose for your life. We're looking at the mind of man. It's such an important teaching and it's taken us a while to get into it because there's a lot to see, but we've already seen a couple of things. Let me recap some of the things we have seen. 

We have seen what God's purpose is, which is sonship. We are called to be children of God, and we have assignments to carry out. The journey of God's purpose involves a daily life of devotion, an unfolding natural assignment, as well as an unfolding spiritual assignment. But seeing the roadmap of God's purpose does not substitute for having what it takes to fulfill it. 

## The Central Role of the Mind in God's Purpose

This is why we studied how to fulfill God's purpose through growth. We saw the need for discipleship, for perfecting, for knowledge, and for stature to be able to bear the burden of purpose. Something that became clear as we examined that was the role of the mind in this entire journey. There is a very important place and a very important role that our mind plays in the walk in God's purpose. 

I could put it this way: your mind is your life. It's just that simple. We sometimes underestimate how much our minds have been conditioned by what they have been exposed to. We underestimate the way our background can force our minds to reproduce the life it was exposed to. One day we might get the chance to talk about that because, at the core, when we speak about generational curses or generational patterns, it is often this. 

The same strongholds on the minds of other people condition us in our early days and are now reproduced on the minds of those of us who relate with them. It becomes a replicated pattern that keeps happening. We might underestimate how strong the influence of our background is in defining us now. Usually, when we do this, we can underestimate it and just say, "Yeah, I'm a new creation, I'm not like that."

## Background Conditioning and the Need for Introspection

Rather than waving it off, we need some real introspection. When Paul says in Ephesians 4:17, "see then that you no longer walk," it means I used to walk in a particular kind of mind. I need to sit down and look at what the tendencies of my mind are based on my background. You could have hate, bitterness, anger, or harshness. There are good things you could have had too, like love and discipline, but you could also have harshness which you cover up by saying you are just "disciplined."

We sometimes tend to be more critical of others than we are of ourselves, which is not the disposition of scripture. The Lord told us that we as individuals need honest self-introspection before trying to cross-examine others. In Mark 7, He spoke about paying attention to the log in your own eye before the speck in other people's. That is using the same energy that you would use in judging others on yourself. 

It's something to take seriously. It wasn't just a backhand response to hypocrisy; it is really an instruction. You need to examine yourself and have honest self-introspection. What is the state and the conditioning of my mind? What are the things that I need to correct? Your mind is your life. The day you realize your mind is your life and you ask, "What life do I want? Is that life my mind?" then you're just waking up.

## The State of the Unbelieving Mind

The life you should want is the life of God's purpose. That means you're supposed to be a person walking in love and walking in righteousness. If you look at your life now and it doesn't reflect that life, then it means something on your mind is wrong. There's no point beating yourself up over it; that's true of every one of us. We all have areas where we are wrong and we need to fix it. 

Rather than beating yourself up, you'll be one step ahead of others if you have been able to identify exactly where you are wrong on your mind. Probably because of the household you grew up in or the places you went, certain conditions tend to create patterns. You would have to address those things with the word. Ephesians 4:17 says the reason why the Gentiles walk the way they do is because of the futility of their mind. 

In Ephesians 2:1-3, we saw that when we were dead in trespasses and sins, we were walking in the desire of the flesh—our nature—but also in the desire of the mind. This implies that nature and the world had affected our mind. Our mind is so important. It is a complex place with different things going on, and the information in scripture is expected to be constructed into a whole so that we can address the mind, fix it, and live out the life of purpose.

## Salvation, Discipleship, and the Work of Growth

In Ephesians 4:17-19, Paul uses five descriptions to explain why the unbelieving world walks the way they do. Four of them speak to the mind: walking in the futility of their mind, having their understanding darkened, the ignorance that is in them, and the blindness of their heart. Only one speaks to nature—being alienated from the life of God. Their work is a product of their mind, which is tuned into the world because of their nature. 

You shouldn't be like that. You have a new nature, and in that light, your mind should now be tuned into your own nature. But because you used to have this same old mind, you have a lot of work to do. We see people who are quick to lambast the faith of Christ for the imperfections of its believers, but shouldn't we be grateful for what Christ has done just because some people are not yet altogether in their growth? 

We should be able to be wholesome in complaining about those who need to grow without speaking unduly down on the important sacrifice that the Lord had to make. There was no other way to save us from sin and death than what Christ did. We need the salvation first, then we can talk about discipleship. We need awesome discipleship to be well-armed, wholesome, and ready for all that life may throw at us.

## Learning Christ and the New Creation

In Ephesians 4:20, it says, "You have not so learned Christ." When he switches from talking about unbelievers to those of us who have believed, he's still addressing the mind. Learning and discipleship are matters of the mind. If indeed you have heard Him and have been taught by Him, the truth as it is in Jesus ought to be on your mind. 

The four descriptions of the unbelieving mind were negative. Futility means emptiness—something should be there but is not. Darkness is the absence of light. Ignorance and blindness also point to something missing. By the time he switches over to those who believe in Jesus, he is pointing to what *is* on our mind, which is Christ and the truth. 

Specifically, he says that you put off, concerning your former conversation, the old man. What is pointing to that is not on the mind is a particular reality: the reality of the new creation. This is something we'll come back to later, but for now, we are making progress. I'll see you on the next episode where we talk further about the mind from where we are stopping now. Thank you.
