# The Mind of Man (Part 3)

We have been exploring the mind of man, a crucial area of study. This teaching is extensive, but we have already covered several foundational points. We began by understanding God's purpose, which is sonship—we are called to be children of God with specific assignments to carry out. The journey of God's purpose encompasses a daily life of devotion, an unfolding natural assignment, and an unfolding spiritual assignment. However, merely understanding this roadmap does not equip us to fulfill it.

Our previous studies focused on fulfilling God's purpose through growth. We identified the necessity of discipleship, perfecting, knowledge, and spiritual stature to bear the burdens of purpose effectively. Throughout this examination, the pivotal role of the mind in this entire journey became increasingly clear. Our mind plays an incredibly significant role in our walk toward God's purpose.

## The Central Role of the Mind in God's Purpose

Put simply, your mind is your life. We often underestimate the profound extent to which our minds have been conditioned by past exposures. We may not fully grasp how deeply our background can compel our minds to reproduce the very life experiences we were exposed to. This dynamic is often at the core of what is sometimes referred to as generational patterns or strongholds.

The mental strongholds present in others can condition us during our formative years, subsequently reproducing themselves in the minds of those who relate to them. This creates a replicated pattern that perpetuates across generations. We might underestimate the powerful influence our background exerts in shaping who we are today, often dismissing it by saying, "I'm a new creation; I'm not like that."

## Background Conditioning and the Need for Introspection

Rather than simply dismissing these influences, we require genuine introspection. When Paul states in Ephesians 4:17, "see then that you no longer walk," he implies a past way of thinking and living. This calls us to examine the inherent tendencies of our minds, shaped by our background. These tendencies might include hate, bitterness, anger, or harshness. While some positive traits like love and discipline may also be present, harshness can sometimes be rationalized as mere "discipline."

We frequently exhibit more criticality toward others than toward ourselves, a disposition contrary to scripture. The Lord instructed us to engage in honest self-introspection before attempting to scrutinize others. In Mark 7, Jesus emphasized attending to the "log in your own eye" before the "speck in other people's." This means applying the same rigor and energy we might use in judging others to self-examination.

This instruction is not merely a retort against hypocrisy; it is a serious directive. We must honestly examine ourselves: What is the current state and conditioning of my mind? What are the areas I need to correct? Your mind is your life. The moment you grasp this truth and begin to ask, "What life do I desire, and does my mind align with that life?" is the moment you truly begin to awaken.

## The State of the Unbelieving Mind

The life you should desire is the life of God's purpose—a life characterized by love and righteousness. If your current life does not reflect this, it indicates an issue within your mind. There is no benefit in self-condemnation; this applies to all of us. We each have areas where we err and require correction.

Instead of berating yourself, you will gain a significant advantage by accurately identifying precisely where your mind has been wrongly conditioned. Influences from your upbringing or past environments can establish certain patterns. These patterns must be addressed with the Word of God. Ephesians 4:17 explains that the Gentiles live as they do because of the futility of their minds.

Ephesians 2:1-3 further reveals that when we were spiritually dead in trespasses and sins, we walked according to the desires of our fleshly nature and the desires of our minds. This suggests that both our inherent nature and the world had impacted our minds. Our mind is profoundly important; it is a complex domain. The information found in scripture must be holistically applied to address and correct the mind, enabling us to live out God's purpose.

## Salvation, Discipleship, and the Work of Growth

In Ephesians 4:17-19, Paul provides five descriptions for the unbelieving world's conduct. Four of these directly pertain to the mind: walking in the futility of their mind, having their understanding darkened, the ignorance within them, and the blindness of their heart. Only one description speaks to nature: being alienated from the life of God. Their actions are a direct product of their minds, which are attuned to the world due to their unregenerate nature.

As believers, we are not meant to live this way. We possess a new nature, and consequently, our minds should now be aligned with this new nature. However, because we once operated with the old mind, there is significant work to be done. We observe people who are quick to criticize the Christian faith due to the imperfections of some believers. Yet, should we not first express gratitude for Christ's profound sacrifice, even while acknowledging that some believers are still in the process of growth?

We should be able to constructively address the need for growth among believers without unduly diminishing the vital sacrifice the Lord made. There was no other way to deliver us from sin and death apart from Christ's work. Salvation is the foundational necessity, followed by discipleship. Robust discipleship is essential to being well-equipped, whole, and prepared for all the challenges life presents.

## Learning Christ and the New Creation

Ephesians 4:20 declares, "You have not so learned Christ." When Paul transitions from discussing unbelievers to addressing those who have believed, he continues to focus on the mind. Learning and discipleship are fundamentally matters of the mind. If you have indeed heard and been taught by Him, then the truth, as it is in Jesus, ought to occupy your mind.

The four descriptions of the unbelieving mind were inherently negative: futility implying emptiness where something should be, darkness as the absence of light, and ignorance and blindness all pointing to something missing. In contrast, when Paul speaks to believers, he points to what *is* now present in our minds: Christ and the truth.

Specifically, he instructs us to "put off, concerning your former conversation, the old man." This refers to a profound reality: the reality of the new creation. This concept will be further explored in future discussions, but for now, we recognize the progress made in understanding the critical role of the mind.
