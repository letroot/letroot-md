# Gospel Answers Series 4

## Understanding Truth Through Observation

Welcome to the Gospel Answer series. We are still looking at the gospel's relationship to truth. We have established the gospel's claim of truth and how to know that truth, which is by observation and reason. You know whatever is true by observation and reason; for example, you know your height by going to a measuring tape and seeing the result. You can similarly know facts about your physical reality through these same tools.

Observational reason is how we know the truth. I used the example of the color of a book—you look at it, you think about it, and you know. This is the simplified version of Gospel Answers. There are many things I would say when we get to the critical version, but I am providing this as a simple background foundation for your understanding.

When we get to the critical version, we will look at deeper questions, such as how we are sure anything is true at all. We will explore radical skepticism and the foundational axioms that make for rational inquiry. For now, let us get back to the simplified version: truth is known by observation and reason.

## The Message Revealed in Creation

What is it that we observe and reason to know that there is God? Paul tells us that the invisible attributes of God are made obvious by the finitude and contingency of the world. Before I explain that further, consider Romans chapter 10. In verse 13, Paul says, "Whosoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved," which refers to believing the gospel.

Verse 14 then asks, "How shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe on him of whom they have not heard?" We confess Him because we have believed, and we believe because we have heard. This is a standard progression, but Paul asks a startling question in verse 18: "But I say, have they not heard?"

He answers, "Yes indeed," and quotes a Psalm stating that "their sound has gone out to all the earth, their words to the ends of the world." Paul is saying that the sound and words of God's message have already gone out into all the earth. We must go back to the book of Psalms to see how exactly this message has reached everyone.

## The Language of the Natural World

In Psalm 19, verse one says, "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows his handiwork." When we observe the cosmos, it declares God's glory. This mirrors Paul’s argument that since the creation of the world, God's invisible attributes are clearly seen and understood by the things that are made. What we witness in this finite world points to the reality of God.

Verse two explains how this works: "Day unto day utters speech, and night unto night reveals knowledge." There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard. It is not saying a person is speaking; rather, it says that this message is revealed in nature itself. Day unto day is uttering speech, and night unto night is revealing knowledge to all humanity.

## The Argument from Time and Finitude

The idea of "day unto day" refers to time. We can see time counting forward, pointing towards a specific conclusion. This is a basic cosmological argument: because the world is finite in time, it cannot have an infinite past. This necessitates a cause—God—to have brought the world into existence.

If you live in a world where time is counting, it is moving forward, but it cannot count backwards forever. If time went back endlessly, we would never be able to arrive at this present day. Arriving at "today" would be a contradiction if you had to cross an infinite past to get here. This logic has been at the heart of faith for ages.

Clearly, a finite world must have an origin that is self-existent. The finitude of the world is the first pointer to the reality of God. The second pointer is the contingency of the world—the fact that the heavens are "handiwork" or something made. We are going to look at that contingency in the next episode.
