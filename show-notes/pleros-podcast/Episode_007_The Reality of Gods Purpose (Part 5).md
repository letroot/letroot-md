# The Reality of God's Purpose (Part 5)

Welcome to Pleros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it. 

Brothers and sisters, welcome to another episode of the Pleros podcast, your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. I think we have been dwelling a bit on that last part of the equation, which is God's purpose of recent, because you've been following us and you have at this juncture gotten an understanding of what God's purpose is. We've seen that God's purpose is not a matter of our personal opinions or desires; it's rather a matter of his own revelation. 

## The Need for Objective Revelation

If you talk about someone's purpose, whether it's your own purpose, it would be strange if someone imposes their own preference on you as your own purpose. It's kind of the same way if we are found imposing on God what we prefer as his own purpose. And that's why we said on the subject matter of God's purpose, we must recognize the need for revelation, but separate the objective revelation we get from the direct revelation of God, which is the Bible, from the subjective revelation we get from experiences, voices, or an inward witness.

We must separate the objective revelation we get from the direct revelation of God's word, which is the Bible. We have examined the reason why we hold the scriptures as direct revelation as believers in Christ Jesus. We saw that there is the truth of the gospel, and that truth is fulfilled in the person of Jesus. The person of Jesus validates the scriptures and therefore, for us, the Bible is the authoritative document for truth and revelation. 

One is foundational and the other is built on that foundation. The objective revelation of God's purpose found in his word is foundational. The subjective revelation you could receive about what the Lord will have you do is built on the objective one. If you get it wrong relative to what is objectively God's purpose written in black and white in his word, you are likely not going to interpret your subjective revelation properly.

## Sonship: The Good Pleasure of His Will

Now, not to belabor that matter, what have we seen God's purpose to be? You recall we have seen Ephesians 1:9, where we are told that God has made known the mystery of his will, which is what he wants according to his good pleasure. We have also seen Ephesians 1:5, which says that what God wants and God likes is sonship. He predestined us to sonship or adoption as children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will. 

Whatever he predestined us to has to be the good pleasure of his will. In the light of what he likes and what he wants, he predestined us to sonship. Oh, that must be precisely what the good pleasure of his will is. We have other texts to attest to that, such as Romans chapter 9, which says the first thing Paul told us God reflected in the Israelites is the reality of sonship, which is his purpose.

We have explained what sonship is from Romans chapter 8 and verse 15. Paul says we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear. This means that when we become saved, we are not put under bondage or slavery as was the case when we were under the reign of sin and death. The manner of interaction, the modus operandi that is at play when we are saved, is not the way things used to be.

## From Bondage to the Spirit of Adoption

We were not forced and beaten down to function under sin, death, and darkness. In this case, we are given the privilege to walk in the freedom of his life by God's nature. I must be careful to say that while we are servants or even slaves of righteousness, these things are a matter of willingness because they are the positive things that we are natured to do. God is working in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure.

This is much different from when you are under the flesh, where someone is bound by certain conducts and habits that the person no longer wants to engage with but is still trapped in. We are not in that kind of a situation. We have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but the spirit of adoption or sonship whereby we cry, "Abba, Father." Glory to Jesus, you have the spirit of sonship.

Verse 16 explains that when we put the spirit of sonship to work, the spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. That word "children" means you have God's very nature. These two spirits, when put to test, have the same testimony. We are children of God, and that is the first reality of sonship.

## Understanding Our Position as Heirs

But then there's another reality of sonship: if children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ. In Galatians 4, we see that a child, even though he is indeed already the master of all things, differs nothing from a slave while he is an infant. If you have an infant who is unable to yet speak or process complex reasoning, you cannot expect the child to direct the activities of your house or your business.

The reality of being an heir of God defines sonship. The concept of sonship is the idea that the child would be given responsibility over what the father owns. That is why, in talking about sonship with Israel, God said, "Israel is my son, my firstborn." The firstborn privilege, which is the privilege of being an heir, is committed to all of them, not just some of them. 

When you say, "I am a son of God," you are not speaking to the effect of gender. You are simply saying, "I am an heir of God." In this case, you are God's child who is also his heir. The reality of God's purpose is that he wants us as his children to fellowship with him. That is the very essence of this relationship—primarily about that beautiful fellowship where we cry, "Abba, Father."

## The Two Classes of Inheritance

But then we must ask: what are we then to do as heirs of God? Being an heir means God has allotted something to us—things he has given us to do and fulfill. The word is *kleronomos*. *Kleros* means a lot or a portion of property, and the root *nomos* means assigning or instructing. As an heir, you are one who has been assigned a lot, and our question is: what lot exactly have we been assigned?

There are two classes of inheritance that we have. If you think about existence, there are just two classes of things that exist: the self-existent, which is God, and created existence, which is the cosmos. What God can give to anyone that he owns, other than himself, is the world he has created. Humanity is meant to inherit this world and bring it under the reign of life.

Romans chapter 4 speaks of Abraham being the heir of the whole world. In Colossians 3:22-24, Paul tells servants to work heartily as to the Lord, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. Our first assignment is what we can call a natural inheritance. We’re going to pick it up from here next session as we see what this natural inheritance is all about. Catch you on the next one.
