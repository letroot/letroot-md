# The Reality of God's Purpose (Part 5)

We have been exploring God's purpose, recognizing that it is not a matter of our personal opinions or desires, but rather a revelation from God himself. It would be strange to impose our preferences on God and call them His purpose, just as it would be inappropriate for someone to dictate our own purpose. This understanding underscores the critical need for revelation concerning God's purpose.

## Objective vs. Subjective Revelation

We must differentiate between objective revelation, which comes directly from God through the Bible, and subjective revelation, which stems from personal experiences, inner voices, or an inward witness.

The Bible serves as the direct and objective revelation of God's Word. We hold the Scriptures as authoritative because the truth of the gospel, fulfilled in the person of Jesus, validates them. For believers in Christ, the Bible is the ultimate document for truth and revelation.

Objective revelation, as found in God's Word, forms the foundation. Subjective revelation, which guides our personal walk and service, must be built upon this objective foundation. Misinterpreting God's objective purpose, as revealed in the Scriptures, will inevitably lead to a flawed understanding of any subjective revelation we receive.

## The Core of God's Purpose: Sonship

God's purpose, as revealed in Ephesians 1:9, is the "mystery of his will," what He wants according to His good pleasure. Ephesians 1:5 further clarifies this, stating that God "predestined us to sonship or adoption as children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will."

Therefore, sonship is precisely the good pleasure of God's will. Romans chapter 9 corroborates this, indicating that sonship is the reality God first reflected in the Israelites, revealing it as His core purpose.

Romans chapter 8, verse 15, explains the essence of sonship. Paul writes that "we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear." This signifies that upon salvation, we are not subjected to the slavery or bondage experienced under the reign of sin and death. Our interaction with God is transformed; it is no longer the way things used to be.

## Embracing the Spirit of Adoption

We are no longer compelled or suppressed to function under sin, death, and darkness. Instead, we are granted the privilege to live in the freedom of His life, empowered by God's very nature. While we may be called servants or even "slaves of righteousness," this service is born of willingness, reflecting the positive actions we are now natured to perform. God actively works in us "both to will and to do of his good pleasure."

This stands in stark contrast to being under the flesh, where individuals are trapped by behaviors and habits they wish to abandon but cannot. We are not in such a predicament. We have received "not the spirit of bondage again to fear, but the spirit of adoption or sonship whereby we cry, 'Abba, Father.'" We possess the spirit of sonship.

Verse 16 clarifies that as the spirit of sonship operates, "the Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God." The word "children" here implies possessing God's very nature. These two spirits, when examined, bear the same testimony: we are children of God. This is the primary reality of sonship.

## Understanding Our Position as Heirs

Beyond being children, another reality of sonship is that "if children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ." Galatians 4 illustrates this by explaining that a child, though inherently the master of all things, is no different from a slave while an infant. An infant, unable to speak or reason complexly, cannot be expected to manage a household or business.

The essence of sonship, therefore, involves the child eventually being entrusted with responsibility over the father's possessions. This is why God declared of Israel, "Israel is my son, my firstborn." The firstborn privilege, that of being an heir, was committed to all of them, not just a select few.

When we declare, "I am a son of God," it is not a gender-specific statement. It means, "I am an heir of God." We are God's children who are also His heirs. God's purpose is for us, His children, to fellowship with Him. This beautiful fellowship, where we cry, "Abba, Father," is the very essence of our relationship with Him.

## The Classes of Our Inheritance

As heirs of God, we must ask: what exactly are we called to do? Being an heir means God has allotted something to us – specific tasks and responsibilities to fulfill. The Greek word *kleronomos* signifies an heir; *kleros* refers to a lot or portion of property, and the root *nomos* denotes assigning or instructing. Thus, an heir is one who has been assigned a lot. Our question then becomes: what specific lot have we been assigned?

Our inheritance falls into two main classes. Existence itself can be broadly divided into two categories: the self-existent (God) and created existence (the cosmos). Apart from Himself, what God can bestow upon anyone He owns is the world He created. Humanity is intended to inherit this world and bring it under the reign of life.

Romans chapter 4 declares Abraham to be the "heir of the whole world." Similarly, Colossians 3:22-24 instructs servants to "work heartily, as to the Lord... knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance." Our initial assignment is what we can term a natural inheritance.
