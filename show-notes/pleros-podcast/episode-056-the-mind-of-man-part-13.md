# The Mind of Man (Part 13)

We continue our study on the mind of man, focusing on how it relates to God's purpose for our lives. God's ultimate purpose is for us to walk in sonship, both as his child and as his heir. As a child, we are called to walk in fellowship with him, embodying his nature and character. As an heir, we are entrusted with assignments, both natural and spiritual, with the spiritual assignments taking priority due to their eternal worth and weight.

Fulfilling God's purpose involves a specific journey, often described as a "race" in the New Testament. Paul, in 2 Timothy 4:7, declares, "I have finished the race," and Hebrews 12:1 exhorts us to "run with patience the race that is set before us." This signifies a defined path, but simply knowing the path is not enough; we also require the strength for the race itself.

## The Mind: The Seat of Spiritual Growth

To bear the burden of God's purpose, we must understand how we are built, prepared, developed, and discipled. This leads to a crucial conclusion: the primary place where spiritual growth occurs is in our mind, not our spirit. Our spirit, through being born again, is already 100% like our Father’s; we are one spirit with the Lord, new creations.

Our spirit exists in a perfectly complete and divine state that cannot be improved upon. Therefore, when we speak of "growing spiritually," we should not mistake it for something happening to our spirit. Instead, the most accurate depiction is that our spirit is no less complete than that of any other believer. The significant difference in our spiritual walk lies squarely in the development and transformation of our mind, and this is where our attention must be directed.

## Metaphysical Influence in a Physical World

From a biblical worldview, human beings are best understood as a spirit possessing a mind, and inhabiting a body with a brain. While the brain and mind engage in many natural activities with no direct spiritual implication—such as studying physics, chemistry, or biology purely as matter—our mind also inescapably deals with metaphysical matters.

When educators teach physical sciences, they often, consciously or unconsciously, infuse their metaphysical persuasions into their instruction. Whether they disregard any divine correlation or embrace it, their worldview will inevitably manifest. The same principle applies to commerce and art, where ethical and spiritual influences invariably permeate communication and expression. It is essential to recognize that while we interact with natural phenomena, we are consistently exposed to and communicate spiritual influences.

## Exploring the Faculties of the Mind: Nous and Dianoia

Having established that humans are spirits with minds and bodies with brains, and referencing texts like 2 Corinthians 4:16 concerning the inward and outward man, we now delve into the specific aspects and compartments of the mind. The New Testament primarily uses two Greek words for "mind": *nous* and *dianoia*.

*Dianoia* frequently denotes the state of one's knowing or the concluded state of one's reasoning. For example, when the Lord commands us to love him with all our mind, it implies that this love should be our unwavering persuasion and the ultimate conclusion of our reasoning. In contrast, Luke 24:45 uses *nous* when Jesus "opened their understanding," highlighting the reasoning process itself and the removal of mental blinders through his explanation.

We observe the interplay of these terms in Ephesians 4:17-18, which cautions against walking in the "futility of their mind" (*nous*) and having their "understanding darkened" (*dianoia*). Here, the concluded state of their mind is devoid of light and opposed to the truth in Christ. Conversely, Ephesians 1:18 prays that the "eyes of your understanding" (*dianoia*) be enlightened, signifying that the truth of being a new creation has become a deeply held conviction.

## From Conviction to Action: The Mind's Role in Our Walk

To summarize, we have identified four key aspects of the mind: reasoning, memory, the will, and conviction. Conviction is intrinsically linked to free will, requiring us to actively choose, upon examination, to agree or disagree with the information presented. Our reasoning faculties present decisions to our will, and it is through our will that we accept what we perceive as true. Thus, our process involves reasoning, retaining memories, and allowing our will to solidify our convictions.

In Romans 6, Paul addresses the progression within the mind. He challenges believers with the question, "Do you not know?" concerning their baptism into Christ’s death, implying they should already have embraced this truth. These individuals, having accepted God's grace, questioned whether they should continue in sin. While they understood the reality of redemption, they had not yet grasped how to practically apply that knowledge.

Paul highlights that there is a stage beyond mere knowledge and conviction. Another part of our mind is responsible for producing our outward results. Our work and actions are not solely a product of conviction. If we fail to understand what truly drives our actions, we will continue to struggle in our spiritual walk.
