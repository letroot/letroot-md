# The Mind of Man (Part 18)

Welcome to Pleros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

All right, welcome back to the Pleros podcast. This is your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. This is our very last episode on the mind of man. We want to really finish up on the subject matter by focusing on consciousness in the mind of man. 

You recall that our study has been inspired by the understanding we have of God's purpose, which is sonship. We are called by God to be in His family, to fellowship with Him as well as with other members of the family, and also to carry out the assignments He has for us. This assignment that God has for us is both natural and spiritual. 

There's a road map to follow in carrying out our assignment, and very importantly, we need the capacity and the strength to fulfill that assignment. This helps us to see the need for discipleship and the perfecting of the saints. Without discipleship, we will be too weak or ineffective in bearing the burdens of purpose as we walk the journey.

## The Seat of Spiritual Growth

It has become imperative for us to understand this growth that we need to bear the burden of purpose. What we identified is that this growth does not happen in our spirit. We do not grow spiritually in our spirit; we grow in our minds. Spiritual growth is the influence of God's word and truth upon our minds.

The mind is the seat of growth, and that has forced us to study the mind of man. We have seen first that man is a spirit with a mind that has a body with a brain. While our spirit is in a complete, perfect, and divine state, our mind needs to match up, and that matching up requires knowledge. 

Beyond knowledge, something needs to happen to another part of our mind which occurs by reckoning and affirming. This affects our consciousness. If we receive the knowledge of the word in church, it affects our conviction. We reason through what is said and meditate until we agree or disagree, which forms our conviction.

## Understanding Conscience as Co-Perception

Knowledge affects your conviction and enlightens your mind, but then we need to reckon and present ourselves to affect our consciousness. We said that consciousness is primarily taken from the word "conscience." We have been looking at Titus 1:15, which explains that even the mind and conscience can be defiled.

The word conscience in the Greek is *suneidesis*, from two words: *sun*, meaning "together," and *eido*, meaning "to perceive." It literally means to perceive together. This implies that there are two entities that are perceiving. While perception is normally a natural phenomenon using the five senses, conscience is a co-perception.

When you use the word conscience, you are talking about a mental perception alongside your natural perception. It is your mind perceiving alongside what your natural senses are experiencing. For example, some people have had their minds poisoned regarding certain groups of people based on past experiences. 

If someone walks up to them to have a conversation, it might immediately send a trigger to their mind and cause them to react. That is their conscience reacting. What the person did might be entirely harmless to someone else, but to them, it is considered harmful because their conscience is reacting to the perception.

## Aligning the Conscience with Truth

We see that a conscience can be seared or unfeeling, or it can be too sensitive toward things it should not feel. We actually are the ones who determine the state of our conscience; it is not automatically thrust on us. Acts 24:16 is a very central text regarding this responsibility. 

There is a mistake we make in thinking about our conscience only as the judgment we make in the instance it is active. Really, there are three levels: the preceding consciousness, the moment of perception, and then the conscious judgment. We often only see the judgment and reaction, but the root is the state of the consciousness.

Paul said in Acts 24:16, "I myself always strive to have a conscience without offense towards God and men." Your conscience might not be right if it is disproportionate to reality. You have to ensure your conscience aligns with truth so that you feel about things the way they actually are. 

It is your work to make your conscience truth-aligned. If you are seeing poison, your conscience should recognize it as poison; if you see good, it should recognize it as good. You need to be intentional about the state of your conscience because it can become a victim of circumstances, background, or trauma if left unaddressed.

## The Hidden Person of the Heart

In Titus 1, Paul warns against giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn from the truth. You can change your conscience by changing what you are giving heed to and what you are reinforcing. Our conscience is meant to be truth-aligned, but many believers are more conscious of their flaws than who they are in Christ.

This "sin consciousness" is not the idea we get from God's word. We ought to align our conscience with the truth by paying attention to what is true about us in Christ. This specific part of our mind, our consciousness, is also what is called the "hidden man" or the "inner man." 

In 1 Peter 3:3-4, Peter tells women to focus on the hidden person of the heart rather than merely outward adornment. He cannot be talking about the spirit because the spirit is already in a perfect state. Most instances of "heart" in scripture point to the mind rather than the spirit. 

The hidden person of the heart is that part of our mind that produces the conduct we have. It is not just the reasoning part or the conviction; it is the consciousness. What you are affirming there makes for the conduct that you have. We will see more of this when we look at faith in the next episode.
