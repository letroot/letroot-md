# The Mind of Man (Part 18)

This final episode on the mind of man focuses on consciousness. Our study has been inspired by the understanding of God's purpose: sonship. We are called into God's family for fellowship, both with Him and with other members, and to fulfill specific assignments—natural and spiritual. To carry out these assignments, a roadmap is required, along with the capacity and strength to fulfill them. This highlights the necessity of discipleship and the perfecting of the saints. Without discipleship, we risk being too weak or ineffective to bear the burdens of purpose throughout our journey.

Understanding the growth needed to bear the burden of purpose is crucial. This growth does not occur in our spirit, which is already complete. Instead, spiritual growth takes place in our minds, as they are influenced by God's word and truth. The mind is the seat of this growth, which has necessitated our study of the human mind. We understand man as a spirit possessing a mind and inhabiting a body with a brain. While our spirit is perfect and divine, our mind requires alignment, a process that begins with knowledge.

Beyond mere knowledge, another aspect of our mind is influenced through reckoning and affirmation, which directly impacts our consciousness. When we receive the word, it shapes our convictions. We reason and meditate on what is taught until we either agree or disagree, thereby forming our beliefs.

## The Nature of Conscience as Co-Perception

While knowledge affects conviction and enlightens the mind, impacting our consciousness also requires active reckoning and self-presentation. Consciousness, in this context, draws its meaning primarily from the word "conscience." As explored in Titus 1:15, both the mind and conscience are susceptible to defilement.

The Greek word for conscience, *suneidesis*, is derived from *sun* (together) and *eido* (to perceive), literally meaning "to perceive together." This implies a dual perception. While natural perception occurs through the five senses, conscience represents a *co-perception*.

Conscience, therefore, signifies a mental perception occurring in conjunction with natural sensory experience. For instance, individuals whose minds have been tainted by past negative experiences with certain groups may react immediately when approached by someone from that group. This is their conscience reacting. What might be an entirely harmless interaction for others is perceived as threatening by them, solely due to their conscience's interpretation of the perception.

## Aligning Conscience with Divine Truth

A conscience can be seared, rendering it unfeeling, or it can be excessively sensitive to matters it shouldn't perceive. Crucially, we determine the state of our conscience; it is not merely an automatic response. Acts 24:16 is a foundational scripture concerning this responsibility.

We often mistakenly view conscience solely as the judgment made during an active moment. However, there are three distinct levels: the preceding state of consciousness, the moment of perception, and the subsequent conscious judgment. Our focus tends to be on the judgment and reaction, overlooking that the true root lies in the underlying state of our consciousness.

As Paul stated in Acts 24:16, "I myself always strive to have a conscience without offense towards God and men." A conscience that is disproportionate to reality is misguided. Our duty is to ensure our conscience aligns with truth, allowing us to perceive and feel about things accurately. It is our responsibility to cultivate a truth-aligned conscience. If something is truly harmful, our conscience should recognize it as such; similarly, it should identify what is good. Intentionality is key to managing our conscience, as it can otherwise become vulnerable to the influences of circumstances, background, or trauma.

## The Hidden Person and Sin Consciousness

In Titus 1, Paul warns against adhering to Jewish fables and the commandments of men who have departed from the truth. Our conscience can be transformed by consciously choosing what we give heed to and what we reinforce. While our conscience is meant to be truth-aligned, many believers exhibit a greater consciousness of their flaws than of their identity in Christ.

This "sin consciousness" contradicts the teaching of God's word. We are called to align our conscience with the truth by focusing on our identity in Christ. This specific aspect of our mind—our consciousness—is often referred to as the "hidden man" or "inner man."

In 1 Peter 3:3-4, Peter advises women to prioritize the hidden person of the heart over outward adornment. This "hidden person" cannot refer to the spirit, as the spirit is already in a perfect state. In most scriptural contexts, "heart" denotes the mind rather than the spirit. The hidden person of the heart is the component of our mind that shapes our conduct. It goes beyond mere reasoning or conviction; it is our consciousness. What we affirm in this deep part of our mind directly influences our behavior. This will be further explored when we discuss faith in the next episode.
