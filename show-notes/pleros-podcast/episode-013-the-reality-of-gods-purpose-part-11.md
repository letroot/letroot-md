# The Reality of God's Purpose (Part 11)

Welcome to Plaros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

All right, welcome to Pluros podcast. Let's have our daily dose of God's word transforming us to fulfill God's purpose. Now, we've been on a journey and we have seen a number of things. We have looked at the truth and it has led us all the way to the truth of God's purpose while we are here on earth.

If you recall, Ephesians 1:9 and Ephesians 1:5 give us the revelation of why God made the world: it is because of His good pleasure and will called sonship. He wants us to be sons, and that's not saying male children. Romans 8:15 down to 17 has been highly instrumental in understanding what sonship means and what our purpose on earth is. 

With that understanding, I just want to reiterate some things. We have seen that sonship means two things, or there are two realities that make up sonship. The first is that we are children of God and the second is that we are heirs of God. For the first part of the equation, it means God made us because of His desire to have a family.

## The Nature of Divine Fellowship

The natural desire to have children is a matter of good pleasure, the joy of fellowshipping with one that is produced by you and is of your kind. This desire that is found in humanity originates from the Creator Himself, the self-existent one, God. He is the one who desires to fellowship with us. A core part of His longing is this fellowship, interaction, and intimacy that He shares with us as our Father. 

Whenever you are so opportune to relate with the Father, you should do it out of that recognition of fellowship with the one who made you for Him. On the other hand, being God's child is a literal reality; it's not figurative. It's not that you are simply adopted as His child in name only. This is why we kept explaining that the word adoption can give us a completely wrong mindset about God's purpose.

If you're an adopted child of God, it implies that your nature remains unchanged and you are just God's child by name. That is not the biblical idea at all. You are God's child indeed, reproduced by God, which is why we have the seed of God in us. First John 3:9 and Second Peter 1:4 tell us that we are partakers of the divine nature. 

As His actual children, we can imitate Him and do the things that He does. Ephesians 5:1 says we should imitate God as dear children and walk in love. We should walk as children of light, according to Ephesians 5:8. You are an actual child of God, called to walk in His nature and His character.

## The Drive for Purpose and Fulfillment

Now that's the first part of sonship, but something is added at that juncture. Beyond fellowship and walking in His nature, we often ask: what am I supposed to get done? The reason why the sense of fulfillment, achievement, and pursuit exists is because those things were made by God. God Himself is like that, and He designed us that way. 

The very word "purpose" (prothesis) accurately means there is something set before you to fulfill. There is the word "pro," meaning before, and the other word meaning to put or to place. God put something in front of Himself to do. What He desired in His good pleasure and His will is what He put before Himself to accomplish. 

The sense of fulfillment and accomplishment originates with God, and He gave that same sense to man. There is a sense of fulfillment in man that we don't find with any other created entity. We even saw it in the life of Jesus. In John 4:34, the Lord Jesus said, "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish it." 

What satisfied Him like food was to do the will of Him that sent Him and to finish it. As believers in God and in Christ, we say that God has wired us existentially for His purpose. There is something we have to accomplish. If you do not fill that part of you with God's own purpose, it is likely going to be filled by something else that is worldly and fleshy.

## Our Calling as Heirs of God

It's very important that you find out God's purpose and align yourself with it. You can always be assured that what He is telling you to do is good. There may be difficulties or calls to sacrifice, but that itself is still good. That is the motivation of what we do; we know who we serve is good and what He has called us to do is good.

The part of the sonship equation that addresses this heart of fulfillment is being heirs of God. While being a child of God is a maintained reality of fellowship, being an heir involves something to accomplish. There is a goal set before you and a race to finish. We must be able to talk like Paul did in Second Timothy 4:7, saying, "I fought the good fight, I finished the race, I've kept the faith."

There is that sense of accomplishment and even reward that we should be concerned about when it comes to being heirs of God. We have seen that as heirs, we have been assigned things by God. There is a joint assignment of creation to all believers, but there is also an individual assignment in the natural and the spiritual for each believer. 

First Corinthians 7:17 says that as God has distributed to each one, so let him walk. This is an individual reality, not just a joint allotment. There is something He has parted to you in the natural, as seen in Colossians and Ephesians, and there is also something He has parted to you in the spiritual. 

## Every Believer's Part in the Body

Ministry can be described as what God owns that He assigns to people. We saw that the word for "lot" used for ministry is also used alongside the word "part." We saw that word "part" used for believers and their role in ministry in First Corinthians 12. More importantly, Ephesians 4:16 says that each believer is a part meant to do their share. 

We are all joined to Christ and supply what joins us through the grace of God. When you are perfected as a saint, you do the work of ministry and that edifies the body of Christ. This lead to an end goal where you become as Christ and do the share of your part, causing the growth of the body. 

Ephesians 4:7 says that to each one of us, grace is given according to the measure of the gift of Christ. You cannot hide behind others here, nor can you remove yourself from the mix. This was a letter written to the entire church, not just individuals like Timothy or Titus. It was written to the saints in Ephesus, cutting across the entire spectrum of believers.

He tells the entire church that to each of you, grace is given. When He ascended on high, He led captivity captive and He gave gifts to men. This means that He gave all of us who believe as gifts to humanity. You are given by God as a priest to humanity, a gift with a share to do and a spiritual assignment you must not lose sight of.
