# The Mind of Man (Part 6)

We'll be looking at the mind of man on the foundation of our study on God's purpose. We have seen that God's purpose is sonship—to be God's child and to be God's heirs. This means we are called to a life of fellowship with God where we walk in His nature and character, as well as a life of pursuit of His assignments given to us. That's what we do with our lives daily.

## The Roadmap of God's Purpose and Growth

Having said that, we presently are proceeding in our study to see the roadmap of God's purpose. We saw how we are called to a daily life of devotion, how our natural assignment should unfold, and how our spiritual assignment should unfold. However, having the roadmap doesn't mean we have what it takes to walk the path. We need the strength, fitness, endurance, and discipline to run the race. That is a matter of growth and the stature that we ought to have for that journey. 

That growth is what the Lord accounted for when He called for discipleship. If salvation was the end in all of the Christian faith, then there would be no need for discipleship. Even worse is when we think that now that we are saved, our whole goal is just to make heaven. It can be counterproductive if we think that way, even if it is a noble thought. If our salvation was only about its preservation, we should really be looking for a way to leave the earth immediately right after salvation. 

What then is the essence of our life after salvation? It is the essence of our life in the first place. God's purpose is the reason why we are here. We must understand that the Lord, in instructing discipleship for those who are saved, is not doing so for the preservation of salvation. No, He is doing that for the pursuit of His purpose, for people to walk in the very essence for which He made us.

## Discipleship and the Condition of the Mind

It is important for us to see that discipleship is for growth, and that growth happens in our mind. We have spent a lot of time talking about the role of our mind when it comes to our growth. Ephesians 4 emphasizes that we shouldn't walk as the people who do not believe the gospel do, which is in the contrary condition of their minds. In Ephesians 2, we see that we had that exact same mind, and salvation did not change our mind except for the repentance from dependence on ourselves. 

Salvation did not automatically change our mind in terms of the information we believed or the struggles that were there. What happened to your mind at salvation was a repentance about the condition of the world—recognizing that you need salvation and believing Jesus for it. It gives you a disposition towards sin where you now recognize that sin is wrong, and your heart bleeds in repentance when it happens. However, the fundamental belief systems, worldviews, and habits you had are not automatically changed. These are things that only discipleship will address. 

The church ought to change our mind by the unity of the faith. If you understand that, then you start to realize that the mind is the central issue in this Christian walk. To make that further clear, we saw that the spirit is not the issue. Our nature cannot be improved upon because it is in a perfect, complete, divine state. We are partakers of the divine nature and are one spirit with the Lord.

## Understanding the Inward and Outward Man

At this point, there start to be a lot of questions. If I am saved but my mind wasn't fixed while my spirit is entirely fixed, what is going on? My body also didn't change when I got saved. There are two texts I want you to have in mind at this juncture. First is 1 Thessalonians 5:23, which says the whole of our humanity is spirit, soul, and body. It says, "May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely." 

That first word "completely" means all the way to the end. It is part of God's program to restore our body. For now, we see that the whole of any man is spirit, soul, and body. You might have to pause the understanding of "soul" as just the mind, because we will reexamine how the scriptures use that word later. For example, Ephesians 4:23 says we should be renewed in the "spirit of your mind," which uses the word spirit in a different way.

The second text is 2 Corinthians 4:16, which says, "Therefore, we do not lose heart, even though our outward man is perishing, yet our inward man is being renewed day by day." In this text, he describes man wholesomely as outward and inward. If you say inside and outside, you have covered the entire scope of a thing. This is a mode of description that covers the basis of our humanity. The outward man is talking about our body, which faces mortality and affliction, while the inward man remains fresh.

## Judging According to the New Creation

In 2 Corinthians 5:16, it says our judgment should be based more on the inward man than the outward man. When we look at the outward man, we tend to give certain judgments of people based on gender, race, or social class. But there is a spiritual judgment that is after the inward man. That is how we should judge people, and that is how we should judge ourselves first. If any man is in Christ, he is a new creation. 

Stop being overwhelmed with the thought of being female or male or a certain nationality. Some people are so trained in their minds to think of themselves from the outward man that they don't think, "I am a new creation." They think about the power of their culture or their background instead. I am not saying ignore who you are outwardly, as you need to act accordingly in a scriptural sense. However, we must think from the perspective of the inward man more than the outward man. 

We should be able to think properly about gender, race, and class in the light of the new creation. If you have made the progress of seeing that you are at the core the inward man, then you have made real progress. We are a body with a brain and also a spirit with a mind. This connection between the body with its brain and the spirit with its mind is something I want to build on in the next episode. We will look at the account of the rich man and Lazarus to better appreciate the place of the inward man.
