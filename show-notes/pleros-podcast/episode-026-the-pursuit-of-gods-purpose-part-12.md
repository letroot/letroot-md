# The Pursuit of God's Purpose (Part 12)

## The Nature of Our Spiritual Assignments

Presently, we are focusing on our spiritual assignments. God's ultimate purpose for us is sonship: to be His children and heirs. As His children, we are called to fellowship with Him and embody His character. This 'child' aspect is primarily fulfilled through devotion – prayer, reading, and hearing God's Word. Renewing our minds with Scripture profoundly impacts our prayer life and shapes our character, aligning our walk with God's nature.

We have previously discussed our natural assignments, which begin wherever we are, with whatever work our hands find to do. In earlier discussions, I addressed situations where one might have no current work, emphasizing the biblical mandate to find anything to do, even unpaid, to avoid idleness. Wisdom dictates choosing work that allows for the pursuit of paid employment. The principle is clear: we must work; it is the way of God's Spirit, exemplified by early church leaders like Paul.

Now, we turn our attention to our spiritual assignments, often the most neglected area, largely due to ignorance or a lack of spiritual maturity. We trust that these discussions will help renew your mind. I strongly encourage you to listen attentively and actively challenge any negative perceptions or fears regarding your spiritual calling. Combat timidity and incorrect valuations of your spiritual assignment. Intentionally renew your mind to recognize its value and significance, partnering with the Lord's purpose for your life.

## Every Believer's Unique Spiritual Role

Every believer has a specific spiritual path, much like our natural one. Scriptural texts such as Acts 1, 1 Corinthians 12 (particularly verse 27 and its broader context), and Romans 12 illuminate this truth. While we won't delve into a full ecclesiological study of ministry in the body of Christ here, these passages unequivocally declare that every believer has a distinct role in the spiritual work and ministry God has entrusted to us. This understanding is inescapable.

Ephesians 4 further reinforces this, specifically verse 7: "But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it." The concept of 'measure' is crucial here, indicating a unique portion for each individual. Verse 16 clarifies this further, stating that "each part does its work." This firmly establishes that every believer has a spiritual assignment, a specific measure of grace to fulfill it.

Having recognized this undeniable truth, what then should be our response? What action are we to take when the Lord has given us a spiritual assignment?

## Discipleship: The Foundation of Spiritual Service

Our initial understanding of this general mandate comes from Mark 16: "Go into all the world and preach the gospel." However, Matthew 28, the Great Commission, reveals a deeper goal: "Go therefore and make disciples." This reading clarifies that the goal is a product of discipleship. The apostles themselves were discipled by the Lord, and they were commanded to reproduce others who would likewise go and make disciples. This is precisely what Paul outlines in Ephesians 4, where he speaks to believers, affirming that they all have a part and grace according to their measure to function in leadership and perfect the saints.

Paul's broader message in Ephesians 3 focuses on God's purpose, culminating in a prayer for the church. Ephesians 4:1 then begins with the exhortation to "walk worthy of the calling." This calling into the church requires us to walk in the equality we share as believers. Verse 7 then differentiates, stating, "but to each of you grace is given." So, after highlighting our unity and shared nature in the Spirit, Paul emphasizes our individual distinctions and roles, which are developed through leaders discipling others.

Therefore, the first step in carrying out our spiritual assignment is to be plugged into discipleship. This is the proper understanding of the church's mission outlined in the Great Commission. For those of us who are not the original apostles, the orderly process begins with being discipled. Acts 2:42 illustrates this beautifully: "They continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine." We are to be discipled so that we can then perform the work.

## Activating Your Spiritual Assignment: Go and Publicize

After being discipled in a local church, the second step is to "go" from where you are. This means taking deliberate action and initiative; do not sit still, wait, or expect things to simply happen. Some may hold the idea that God will supernaturally announce them, but that is not the instruction given. Jesus said, "Go." Stop hiding, stop shrinking. While it is true that we should not seek attention for selfish reasons, as a messenger of God's Word, ensuring its visibility to people is paramount. This isn't about personal glory, but about faithfully executing the work entrusted to you. Whether your spiritual work is large or small, you must go out to where people are, minister to them, and be a blessing in every sphere of opportunity. You cannot hide; the message must be put forth.

So, what do we do when we "go"? Mark's Gospel states, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature." Our task, then, is to preach. This preaching leads people to believe, be baptized, and be saved. The specific word used for "preach" here is *kerusso*. *Kerusso* signifies more than just speaking or communicating; it means to publish, to publicize, to proclaim. If you were instructed to *kerusso* information, you might publish it in a newspaper to ensure public awareness. The root of *kerusso* even traces back to the idea of a "town crier" – someone whose job is to make information publicly known.

Thus, the work of preaching the gospel is the work of publishing, publicizing, and proclaiming it. This utilizes various means of communication. You can preach the gospel by speaking to individuals one-on-one, or through digital platforms like your WhatsApp status. It could involve distributing flyers or tracts that convey the message, or even directing people to online resources where they can find answers and hear the gospel for themselves. The key is to publicize the message.

Preaching, however, does not involve coercion or forcing people. Such an attitude is counterproductive and goes against the very spirit of what we aim to achieve. Our goal is to persuade people, to lay forth the evidence of the gospel as the most sufficient and best-evidenced conclusion for the fundamental questions of existence. We bear witness to the truth, as Jesus Himself declared in John 18:37. Your work is to publicize the message, to make it known.

## From Proclamation to Personal Discipleship

Publicizing the message is crucial, but it leads to the fourth point: you are now to disciple those to whom you have publicized the message. This is why one-on-one preaching is particularly important. Almost every other means of widespread publicity, while effective for initial proclamation, may not provide an effective means for discipleship. Therefore, one of the primary reasons to engage in personal, one-on-one evangelism is for the subsequent work of discipleship. This, however, does not diminish the importance of obeying Jesus' *kerusso* instruction to publicize the message as widely and fully as you should. But you must also make time to disciple people as you carry out this work.

The final step is to keep growing in the church through discipleship, led by the Spirit of God. I want to emphasize the importance of your spiritual assignment in God's purpose. It is a priority, of major significance, and arguably the most valuable task the Lord has given you. The lives of people depend on it. Your specific and exclusive role in ministry, given by the Lord Jesus, requires faithfulness, for otherwise, it would ordinarily go undone. While this does not imply that God's ultimate plan would fail, it highlights the unique value and design of your particular part within His purpose. God wants you to occupy that place and to value yourself accordingly, recognizing your indispensable contribution within His overall design. The entire framework of walking in God's plan acknowledges God's foreknowledge, ensuring that even if individuals fail, His purpose will ultimately prevail, yet it simultaneously honors the responsibility and unique design given to each person.
