# Faith Stand (Part 1)

Our primary focus is God's purpose. We began by examining the place of the gospel in our lives, understanding that the gospel is truth.

## The Foundation of God’s Purpose and Sonship

The gospel reveals God's purpose, which we identified as sonship. We explored sonship through Paul's explanation in Romans chapter 8:15-17. Sonship is the reality of being God's child and heir. As God's child, we are called to fellowship with Him, walk with Him in His nature and character, and perform the assignments He has allotted to us as His heirs.

Knowing God's purpose intellectually is not enough. We must understand how to fulfill that purpose through what I call the "roadmap of purpose." This journey involves functioning as a child through the regular maintenance of a devotional life and functioning as both natural and spiritual heirs. It is one thing to know the direction, but another entirely to bear the burden of carrying out His purpose for our lives.

## Understanding Growth and the Inward Man

Growth occurs in the human mind, and this is crucial for recognizing one's place in God's purpose. We enter God's purpose by receiving the spirit of sonship, as Romans 8:15 describes. Receiving the Spirit means one part of the equation is solved: we are entirely new, possessing God's nature and life. However, this does not define growth for the believer. Growth does not happen in our spirit, which is already complete and divine, but rather in our mind.

Spiritual growth is the increasing influence of our spirit on our mind, as opposed to the influence of the flesh or the world. To grasp this, we must appreciate man in his entirety. 1 Thessalonians 5:23 shows that man is spirit, soul, and body, while 2 Corinthians 4:16 describes man as an inward and outward person. The outward person is perishing while the inward person is being renewed day by day. Paul refers to the outward person as a tent, a building, or a cloth, while the inward person is the true individual.

Jesus taught this reality in Luke 16 through the account of Lazarus and the rich man. When their outward bodies died and were buried, their inward selves continued to exist with memory, reasoning, and initiative. This illustrates that the inward person comprises the spirit with the mind, while the outward person is the body with a brain. Just as the brain controls our physical body, the mind controls our spiritual being.

## The Seven Aspects of the Human Mind

Since growth happens in the mind, we need to identify which aspect of the mind determines our conduct. There are seven aspects of the mind to consider. The first is **reasoning**, where we process information. The second is **memory**, where information is stored, whether long-term or short-term. The third is the **will**, which allows us to take initiative and choose to agree or disagree with what is presented to us.

If we agree with information, it becomes our **conviction**, the fourth aspect. A conviction then becomes our **consciousness** or reckoning, which is the fifth aspect. This is what we present and stand on, vital for the "faith stand." The final two aspects are our **emotions**, which are products of our state of reckoning, and our **conscience judgments**, which are our reactive judgments of right and wrong.

Conscience operates through three elements: **preceding consciousness**, **momentary perception**, and **final judgment**. Preceding consciousness is our state of reckoning prior to a situation. At the moment of contact, a dual perception occurs, involving both our natural senses and our mind. This "co-perception" causes us to react and pass a judgment of good, bad, or evil.

## Renewing the Spirit of the Mind

The work of the church aims to address this consciousness and transform our minds. It is not merely about imparting knowledge but refreshing truth so that we are transformed to walk appropriately. Ephesians 4:17 warns against walking as the rest of the Gentiles do, implying that a believer can still possess worldly reasoning, reckoning, and consciousness.

Ephesians 4:20-24 instructs us to put off the old man and be renewed in the spirit of our mind, to put on the new man. This process of putting off and putting on affects our consciousness and relates to how we stand. The next part will explore how faith integrates with this transformative activity.
