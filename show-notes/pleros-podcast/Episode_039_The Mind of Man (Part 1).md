# The Mind of Man (Part 1)

Welcome to the Pleros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Welcome back to the podcast. We are here to give you your daily dose of God's word that transforms you to fulfill God's purpose. Today we are taking on another subject matter that is in the same line of our study. I will try to do a recap and introduction to what we will be looking at today, which is the mind of man.

## Recapping God's Purpose: Sonship and Fellowship

We have seen a couple of things already, starting with the place of the gospel in our life and the reality of God's purpose. I have repeated these points often, and I hope you don't get frustrated with the repetition. As Paul said in Philippians 3:1, to say the same things to you is not grievous but safe. Repetition is expected because God's truth is conclusive and needs to stick.

God's purpose, as seen in Ephesians 1 and Romans 8, is sonship or adoption as sons. Paul explains that we received the spirit of sonship, which gives evidence of being God's child and God's heir. At the core of this spirit is the reality of fellowship. It is a cry of familiarity as we relate with our Father, which is at the very heart of the truth of God's purpose.

You will not truly enjoy the faith if you see it only as a list of things to do or principles to uphold. All those things find their bearing in the light of the relationship truth that defines the Christian faith. We exist because the Creator wanted us, desired us, and loved us to be His own. If that sense of being loved and accepted by God is lacking, your entire walk with God will be affected.

## The Dual Nature of Our Calling: Children and Heirs

The first part of God's purpose is that we are children of God, but the other part of the equation is that we are heirs. Being heirs means there are things assigned or allotted to us as individuals. You exist because of God's purpose; you are not just another face in the crowd or a random occurrence. Holding a worldview of random existence will prevent you from living a life that reflects the intention of the Creator.

As children of God, we are called to a daily life of devotion, including prayer and the reading of the Word. These are the things that make for our development, formation, and growth. On the other side of the equation, as heirs of God, we have assignments to carry out. We must appreciate our place and role on earth, ensuring we are examples that fully reflect the intention of God.

When you carry out your assignments, particularly in the natural realm, it should be a testimony of what you believe. The way you handle your natural work should reflect the goodness and rightness of your faith. While the virtues of our behavior don't compel salvation, acting in ways contrary to good conscience can repel people from the faith.

## Fulfilling Your Assignment with Integrity

In 1 Timothy 6:1, Paul instructs servants to count their masters worthy of all honor so that the name of God and His doctrine may not be blasphemed. If those who hold the faith do not reflect the character of God in what they do, it raises questions in the minds of others. We must pursue both our natural and spiritual assignments properly for the sake of the salvation of souls.

Knowing the journey of God's purpose is different from being able to fulfill it. I often use the example of someone carrying two heavy bags of cement over a long distance. You may see the path and know every twist and turn, but knowing the directions does not substitute for the strength required to carry the weight. You must be able to carry your natural and spiritual assignments while living a devoted life.

This illustrates the absolute need for growth. You may start carrying out your assignments the moment you are saved, but you must get strong, equipped, and trained to do them well. Everything about this growth turns on our mind. It depends on the mind of man, which is the subject we are introducing in this episode.

## The Mind as the Seat of Spiritual Growth

In Ephesians 4, it is clear that the Lord gave leaders to the church to perfect the saints. The end point of this perfecting is the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God. This knowledge is the prerequisite for the stature He wants us to reach—the measure of the fullness of Christ. However, knowledge itself is not the stature; it is possible to know the truth without having the growth that makes for effective work.

Romans 6 highlights this contradiction where people know they are dead to sin but their work does not yet reflect it. Paul tells us not to let sin reign in our mortal bodies, showing that knowledge must be matched by maturity. Many people face challenges in their spiritual growth because they don't understand the mechanics of how growth happens.

Growth is not about "growing our spirits" in a way that ignores the mind. We often make the mistake of thinking our mind is the enemy or struggling to distinguish it from our spirit. Ephesians 4:17 makes it clear that the mind is the seat of all activity regarding growth. By examining the mind of man, we will see how our spiritual development relates entirely to the renewal of our understanding.
