# The Pursuit of God's Purpose (Part 8)

Welcome to Plerose podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

All right, brothers and sisters, welcome to another episode of the Plerose podcast. This is your daily dose of God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We're presently looking at the pursuit of God's purpose. We have seen that God's purpose is sonship, which means to be His child and to be His heir. 

As His child, we are meant to walk in fellowship with Him in His nature and character. Then as His heir, we're meant to carry out our assignments, which include our natural assignment and, very importantly and very critically, our spiritual assignments. Now with all of that background laid, we are looking at the pursuit of that purpose. Now that I know, what do I do? What are the next steps to take? 

## Recapping the Pursuit of Our Natural Assignment

The rule on the pursuit of our assignments can be seen from 1 Corinthians 7:17, where Paul says that as God has distributed to each one, so let him walk. Everybody finds themselves in unique situations or circumstances from where they receive God's purpose. Right from the point where they are saved or realize God's will, they should start walking with God. This is the first and major point: start where you are.

We arrived at the conclusion in the last episode that there are five things to do in pursuit of a natural assignment. Number one, start where you are. Number two, take advantage of opportunities that come to you. Number three, pursue your own desires. Number four, always be open to the leading of the Spirit. Number five, engage your natural assignment with maximum productivity.

The Lord is going to judge your engagement in your natural assignment based on whether you executed it with maximum productivity. If you are doing it for the Lord and you were deliberately lax when you should have been diligent, something is wrong. You would know whether you are giving it your best. You need to be productive, and that is so key.

## Awakening the Zeal for Spiritual Assignment

Having said that, I move on to the next point in our examination: our spiritual assignment. I feel a lot of concern when it comes to our spiritual assignment because it's often neglected. This neglect is really a product of people walking in the flesh; they are weak in their strength to do their spiritual assignment.

We can be so wired for our natural assignment for so long that at the instance of the recognition of our spiritual assignment, we feel weak. If there's anything that is the strength of our spiritual assignment, it is the burden for souls. It is the realization of why you yourself had to be saved and why you had to receive redemption and salvation in Christ Jesus. 

If salvation and redemption mean anything to you, you ought to place the burden and zeal for others on your heart. I don't want to conflate what we want to see afterwards, which is how we fulfill our assignments. We have seen what our assignments are; now we are seeing the steps we take and what to do. 

## The Universal Rule: Start Where You Are

A rule that applies to our natural assignment also applies here: you start where you are. First Corinthians gives a very general rule about walking with God in whatever condition you have found yourself in. This rule applies beyond marriage to your cultural status and your religious identity status. 

You shouldn't be bogged down by those statuses. Focus on whatever conditions you are in, whether you are circumcised or not, and carry out His assignment. You have faith in Christ, so get on with your work. Stop bothering about things that raise questions about the efficacy of what Christ has done. 

How do I start a spiritual assignment? We said start where you are. Mark 16 tells us to just go; he didn't say go only after doing this or that. Understanding Mark chapter 16, we know that we are meant to start our spiritual assignment right from where we are. Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. 

## Discipleship and the Great Commission

There is the rule to start where you are, but you should also be open to the leading of the Spirit. Start where you are with God's word, as that is the leading of the Spirit there. If the Lord tells you to talk about something specific, take a pause, pray, and find out what He wants, just as we saw in Acts chapter 16.

We get a better picture of this in Matthew chapter 28. The Lord told the apostles that all authority has been given to Him in heaven and on earth. He commanded them to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to observe all things He commanded. This instruction to "go therefore" comes back to us as the secondary audience of Jesus's words. 

Notice that He says to go and make disciples. What leads people to carry out their spiritual assignments is that you disciple them by teaching them to observe what He commanded. This is what sets them on course. Discipleship enables them to do their spiritual assignment, and this applies most keenly to the spiritual part of the equation.

## Equipping the Saints for Ministry

Ephesians 4 is essentially Paul explaining the Great Commission. He tells us that when Jesus ascended, He gave gifts to men, including apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. These leaders were given for the "perfecting of the saints." This is what Jesus gave them to do.

In Luke 6:40, the Lord Jesus said that what happens in discipleship is perfecting. A disciple, when perfectly trained, will be as his master. This is the exact word used in Ephesians 4:12. They are given for the discipleship of the saints unto the work of ministry. The work of ministry is the effect of what leaders have done in perfecting the saint. 

Our spiritual assignment, the work of ministry, requires discipleship and the perfection of the saints. This features heavily in how we begin carrying out our spiritual assignments. I have to end there for now, but we're going to continue on the next one. Catch you there.
