# The Mind of Man (Part 2)

We continue our exploration of the mind of man. We are studying this subject because we have identified God's purpose for our lives: Sonship. He has called us to be His children and heirs, meaning He has given us assignments to fulfill as we walk in fellowship with Him and embody His character.

## The Roadmap of Purpose and the Necessity of Growth

You have specific assignments to complete, both natural and spiritual. You can only fulfill these as you fellowship with the Father. However, even with a clear understanding of the journey, the pursuit, and the entire roadmap for fulfilling God's purpose, you will remain unable to accomplish His calling without personal growth.

Consider natural assignments: they begin with your current position, lead to opportunities that arise, and then proceed to your freedom of choice in how you act. Spiritual assignments, by contrast, require commitment to the local church. From there, you must take initiatives to engage others, actively seeking interactions rather than remaining passive. This engagement is primarily physical, but may also extend virtually. You go, you preach, and you are not merely receptive to the Word; you disciple others and help them grow in their own commitment to God's purpose, thereby leading them.

We can provide you with the roadmap for both your natural and spiritual assignments. Yet, even with this complete understanding of the path, if you cannot bear the burden of purpose in the way the Lord expects, then that knowledge alone is insufficient. You must be able to bear the burden of purpose, and that requires significant growth.

## The Goal of Discipleship and the Primacy of the Mind

The primary text we examine concerning growth is Ephesians 4. Our focus on Ephesians 4 stems from the Lord's instruction in Matthew 28 regarding discipleship. In Luke 6, He clarified that discipleship perfects us to become like the Master. Luke 6:40 states that a disciple cannot be greater than his master, but one who is perfectly trained will be like his master. The goal of discipleship, therefore, is to become just like the Master—not more, but precisely like Him. The word used there, "perfectly trained" or "perfect," is *katartizo*.

This verb then appears in Ephesians 4, verse 12, in its noun form, *katartismos*. The Lord Jesus appointed church leaders to disciple us, and this discipleship has a specific endpoint. Ephesians 4:13 describes this endpoint as achieving "the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God." It continues with four descriptions: two relate to knowledge, and two relate to stature or growth. We are to attain full knowledge of God's Word, the unity of the faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God. Furthermore, it states we are to come "to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ." Verse 13 clearly delineates this endpoint of knowledge and growth that the Lord has established for us.

Notice that knowledge pertains to the mind. To know something involves the mind. Crucially, even the "perfect measure of stature of the fullness of Christ" is also fundamentally about the mind. We might mistakenly think that while knowledge is a mental aspect, growth transcends the mind, becoming something that happens to our spirit. Some illustrations suggest viewing one's "spirit man" in the spirit realm as either malnourished or battered. This perspective on our spirit is misleading and can significantly hinder spiritual growth. We must clearly understand that our mind is the defining factor for the entirety of our growth.

## The Gentiles' Walk and the Mind's Futility

Paul emphasizes this point in Ephesians chapter 4, verse 17. After discussing the church's role in our lives, he states, "This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk." Paul asserts that, based on the work of the church, our conduct ought to change. The word "therefore" connects our changed walk to the church's impact. We should no longer walk as unbelievers do.

"Rest of the Gentiles" refers to unbelieving individuals. It is important to appreciate the mindset of both the author and his audience. There was a prevailing understanding that salvation was primarily for the Jews, and Gentiles were considered outside this covenant. Although Paul addressed and resolved this in Ephesians 2, the phrase "rest of the Gentiles" was still used to describe those who had not yet believed the gospel—those who did not possess the life of God, the light of God, or the nature of God within them.

When Paul instructs us not to walk as those who do not believe the gospel, the question arises: how do they walk? He states they walk in "the futility of their mind." All five phrases Paul uses from Ephesians 4:17 to 4:18 to explain why Gentiles walk the way they do relate to the mind, with one exception. He lists: "futility of their mind," "their understanding darkened," "alienated from the life of God," "ignorance that is in them," and "blindness of their heart." Only "alienated from the life of God" does not directly relate to the mind; it speaks to their nature—they lack the very life of God.

## Nature, Desire, and the Unredeemed Mind

To further buttress this point, let us examine Ephesians 2:1: "You He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins." Every believer was once "dead in trespasses and sins," because the reign of sin and death in this world inevitably takes its toll before salvation. You were dead in trespasses and sins, "in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air." Paul describes the same pattern of conduct he addressed in Ephesians 4.

At this point in Ephesians 2, he initially says nothing about the mind, but the subsequent verse brings the mind into focus once more. For now, it simply states you "were dead." This was your nature, and you walked as the dead—physically alive, but spiritually dead. You walked according to the course of this world because the state of death you were in is a state of darkness that defines the world—a state of immorality and unrighteousness. You walked "according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience."

Verse three continues, "among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh." At this point, the focus remains on nature—"the lust of the flesh." Chapter one explains that you were dead in trespasses, walking according to the world's ways, similar to other unbelievers. Then it states you were "fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind." Paul indicates that while desires pertained to our nature, they exerted their dominion over our mind. They were the dominant force influencing our thoughts.

These desires of the flesh exerted power over the mind. Romans 6:12 instructs, "Do not let sin reign in your mortal body." Sin is depicted as a slave master that reigns through its desires. Sin's propaganda permeates this world, and if one accepts and internalizes it, they will behave accordingly because they have received it into their mind. Paul is saying you once walked according to your fleshly nature and the desires that had taken over your mind.

## The Imperative of Mental Transformation

You possessed a certain nature, but your conduct was a product of that nature combined with your mind. It is possible for someone to have a refined mindset, perhaps even contrary to others, yet still exhibit behavior that reflects the flesh, whether through pride, selfishness, or self-righteousness. Without faith in the redemptive work of Christ Jesus, there is an inherent self-dependence.

Without redemption, a person is not entirely relying on God; a form of pride is involved. This aligns with Jesus' teaching that the meek will inherit the earth. Placing your faith in Jesus is an acknowledgment of being "poor in spirit." "Blessed are the poor in spirit; blessed are the meek." These descriptions refer to individuals who recognize their brokenness and their need for help that only God can provide through redemption. This is precisely why not believing the gospel is fatal; no matter how well one has refined their mind, it is still operating under the premise of self-righteousness.

Crucially, the mind is not automatically transformed at salvation. Ephesians 2 highlights that the mind Paul addresses in Ephesians 4 is the same mind we possessed before. He is charging us that, through the work of the church, we are not meant to operate from that same unrenewed mind again. Something profound ought to have changed about that mind. If no such change has occurred, we will continue to conduct ourselves exactly as we did before. You must deeply appreciate the critical role your mind plays in your walk toward God's purpose. Everything ultimately comes down to the transformation of the mind.
