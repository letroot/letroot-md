# How to Fulfill God's Purpose (Part 11)

## The Foundation of Spiritual Growth

Welcome to Plaro's podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it. 

Welcome to another episode of the Player Rose podcast. This is your daily dose of God's word, transforming you to fulfill God's purpose and, I may add, for your life. By now, I'm sure you know what God's purpose is. In this particular session, we are continuing our examination of how to fulfill God's purpose. 

We can say we're looking at growth or spiritual growth. You should recall that God's purpose is sonship; He wants you to be His child. He has fulfilled that by redemption if you have believed the gospel. As His child, He wants you to maintain His life of fellowship, to walk in His nature and His character. 

As His heir, He wants you to carry out the assignment He has given to you, including both a spiritual and a natural assignment. None should be neglected. But even if we know what God's purpose is, we need to understand how it plays out. It's like the example of bearing a heavy burden over a distance; you can imagine it, but you need the fitness and strength to actually do it.

## The Essential Role of Discipleship

That's what we're looking at: how do we carry out God's purpose and bear the weight of His purpose for our lives? Rather than beating yourself up for falling short, you must do what Paul says: you need to know and you need to reckon. The Lord Jesus as well said you need to be discipled. 

If the Lord thought you could carry out His will without discipleship, why would He tell you to be discipled? The assumption that you can afford to do the will of God without discipleship is self-deceit. You would end up doing the will of God with the spirit or mindset of the flesh, which is not healthy for you. 

I encourage you to take the place of discipleship very seriously. I believe in one of the episodes I've recommended a perfecting course, which is our open course for everyone to go through. The outline, pattern, and process of discipleship are not hidden; you simply listen to the teaching. 

When you get to level two, the very first teaching gives you a defense of the exact framework and scheme of work you need for your growth, as laid down by the apostles. Paul calls this the "perfecting of the saints." That perfecting involves receiving the knowledge of the word and coming to the stature that pertains to that knowledge.

## Partakers of the Divine Nature

The knowledge of the word is expansive, but there is a final focus to what we need to know. In Ephesians chapter 4, after discussing the unity of the faith, Paul explains that we need to know the truth that is in Christ. He instructs us to put off the former conversation of the old man and recognize that the end point of all our learning is the new creation. 

There is not a more important truth than that. Peter says in 2 Peter 1:4 that God has given us exceeding great and precious promises. In the original Greek, this is the "greatest promise possible," which is that we should be partakers of the divine nature. This is fulfilled now; you are a partaker of divine nature. 

There is nothing bigger than having God's nature. Your spirit and God's spirit are fused as one; you are one spirit with the Lord. In Colossians 2:9-10, it says that in Christ dwells all the fullness of divinity bodily and you are complete in Him. This text shows a human embodying divinity entirely as a pattern for us. 

We are a complete replica, not embodying Him just to a degree. While we are created and He is self-existent, we are complete in Him. That reality that He has, we have as well. However, the point is that we need to grow into that reality, and growth begins first with knowledge—the knowledge of the new creation.

## Reckoning and Presenting Ourselves

The second part of growth, as seen in Romans 6, is to reckon. Paul says your knowledge doesn't suffice on its own; you must also reckon yourself, which means to affirm and take into account. Another word he uses is "present." Present your members as instruments of righteousness. 

In Romans 12, he uses the same word—present—which means to stand beside. He beseeches us to present our bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God. This means standing beside yourself and affirming, "I am a new creation. I am the righteousness of God. I am dead to sin and alive to God." 

Whether you say it or not, you are still that, but saying it is affirming and reckoning it. That act of presenting yourself does something to you. Romans 12:1 calls this act of presenting yourself your "reasonable service" or regular logical worship. It should be a regular part of your life. 

A prayer life that does not include this regular affirmation of who you are is missing a lot. When the Lord said to pray that you enter not into temptation, He was talking about our character. In the epistles, this is developed into presenting ourselves so that sin does not reign in our mortal bodies.

## Transformation by the Renewing of the Mind

In prayer, we are making an affirmation and recognizing the power of God to walk in victory over the flesh. We are empowering and edifying ourselves. Romans 12:2 says, "Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind." If you don't do the job of presenting yourself, you succumb to the influence of this world. 

If you are not actively presenting yourself as you are in Christ, you are left with no other choice but to be conformed to the world. Transformation happens by the renewing of your mind, which is the effect of presenting yourself. We must realize that knowledge alone does not transform the mind; it only enlightens it. 

Enlightenment is not transformation. You might know you are a new creation and be glad about it, but you might still be a "hearer only." That knowledge does not automatically give you transformation. The renewing of the mind is the continuous refreshing that happens every time you take a stand of faith. 

Every reckoning you do transforms your life and your heart. Our mind is where we have memory and where we consider things, and it is the part that needs transformation because our spirit is already one with the Lord. This transformation by affirmation allows you to walk in the spirit and the purpose of God for your life.
