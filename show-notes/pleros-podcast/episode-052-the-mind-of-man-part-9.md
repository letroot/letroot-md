# The Mind of Man (Part 9)

We have been examining the mind of man, with sonship as the foundational concept of our study. God's desire is for us to be His children and heirs, a purpose we fulfill through mental growth and transformation.

## The Mind: The Engine of Spiritual Growth

Your life is a direct product of your mind. This is both an observable fact and a biblical truth, as every action you take originates in your mind. What occupies your thoughts ultimately dictates your behavior, often conditioned by your background. Without deliberate self-introspection to address and adjust these ingrained patterns, your life will continue to reflect that conditioning.

It is crucial to understand the role of our spirit in this process. When we speak of spiritual growth, we are not suggesting that our spirit itself changes, for our spirit is indissolubly fused with God's spirit. Rather, growth refers to the transformation that occurs within our mind. This marks a key distinction: while the body undergoes physical development, and the spirit remains a permanent reality, the mind is the faculty that undergoes profound transformation.

Even in a state of spiritual darkness or carnal living, a person can "grow" in a negative sense. As Paul describes in Ephesians 4:22, "the old man grows corrupt according to deceit." This degeneration primarily happens within the mind. Therefore, when we speak of the inward man, we are focusing on a growth that specifically impacts the mind, necessitating a thorough study of its various aspects.

## The Inward and Outward Man: A Wholistic View

To comprehend humanity holistically, we refer to 1 Thessalonians 5:23, which states, "May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless." If we perceive ourselves solely in physical and natural terms, we miss the entirety of our existence. There is an outward man and an inward man; the outward man is merely a "tent" or the physical vessel we inhabit.

When considering the concept of the new creation, our judgment should not be based on natural distinctions such as gender, race, or social class. Instead, we must focus on the inner realities of individuals and their faith in Christ Jesus. Regardless of how refined a person's intellect may be, without the life of God, a corruption of self-righteousness subtly underlies all their endeavors.

At the core of a believer's blessedness lies the humility of recognizing the profound need for the salvation Christ provides. A person is not truly blessed unless they acknowledge their spiritual poverty and inability to help themselves. The notion that we are merely "normal" and simply need to align with what is good is a fundamental misunderstanding. In reality, humanity is in a state of profound disrepair due to the pervasive influence of darkness and spiritual death.

## The Necessity of Redemption and Spiritual Insight

It is commendable when individuals demonstrate keen intellect and moral understanding even without embracing the Gospel, and scripture acknowledges such attributes. Conscience, in its essence, distinguishes between life-giving and death-dealing principles. Nevertheless, the fundamental challenge remains aligning oneself with the redemptive work accomplished through Christ Jesus. We must not diminish the importance of helping people recognize their inherent need for redemption, even if this truth may seem uncomfortable.

The inward man remains active even after the physical body ceases to live, as exemplified in the biblical account of Lazarus and the rich man. Even when the body undergoes corruption, the soul maintains its activity. Having established these realities, we must now delve into the specific meanings of "spirit" and "soul" to understand precisely what constitutes true growth.

The Greek word for "spirit" is *pneuma*, traditionally meaning wind or air. This term conveys the idea of an unseen reality that produces visible effects, which is why it is used to describe God, angels, and the spirit of man. These are invisible entities or aspects that manifest tangible impacts in the natural world.

## Distinguishing Spirit and Soul in the Mind

When the Bible speaks of the "spirit of the mind," it does not refer to our regenerated human spirit. Instead, it describes a functional part of our mind directly responsible for what becomes visibly manifest in our actions. Ephesians 4:23 instructs us to "be renewed in the spirit of our mind," indicating that we must address the specific aspect of the mind that generates our behavior, moving beyond mere intellectual knowledge or information.

The mind encompasses various faculties: a part for memory, another for reasoning, and another for emotions. However, the "spirit of the mind" refers to the invisible reality that governs and produces the observable aspects of our conduct and spiritual walk. Not every instance of the word "spirit" in scripture refers to the human spirit; sometimes it denotes this functional part of the mind.

The word "soul" originates from the Greek *psuche*, signifying breath or vitality. This term denotes the animation and aliveness of a person. While "spirit" represents the unseen reality, "soul" embodies the dynamic vitality that enables one to be active. By understanding these distinct aspects—spirit, soul, and body—and their roles, particularly within the mind, we can effectively engage in our growth and become doers of the word.
