# The Mind of Man (Part 10)

Welcome back to the Plerose podcast. This is your daily dose of God's word, transforming you to fulfill God's purpose for your life. Remember, we're looking at the mind of man, but also recall what God's purpose is. God's purpose is sonship; He wants you to walk as His child and heir on a daily basis.

Our study has been on how to fulfill this purpose. We have seen the roadmap of God's purpose and how the journey unfolds. We have seen that fulfillment comes through growth, which led us to the conclusion that our mind determines if we fulfill God's purpose. It is the mind that determines it, and I hope this truth truly gets to you.

## The Centrality of the Mind in God’s Purpose

The limitations of your mind are really a limitation on God's purpose for your life. Sometimes the world and the flesh have placed certain limitations on our minds. I know this personally, as I have had to work hard against limitations from my own background and different ways they can impose themselves.

You need to fight hard with all seriousness and intentionality against the limitations imposed by the world or the flesh. Take it seriously, for your mind is your life and the determinant of God's purpose for you. There is nothing that determines God’s purpose like your mind; in fact, it is the only thing that does.

We see this particularly in the instruction of discipleship the Lord Jesus gave, which is also the instruction to perfect the saints that Paul explains in Ephesians chapter 4. Paul tells us that our perfecting is to bring us to the juncture of the "perfect man" and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. He describes the endpoint of this perfecting through both knowledge and stature.

## Breaking the Limitations of the World and Flesh

The first part says we are to come to the nature of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God. The second part speaks of a perfect mind and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. All four descriptions are about the mind. This is why verse 17 warns us not to walk as unbelievers do, in the futility of their mind.

Their understanding is darkened, they are alienated from the life of God, and there is ignorance in them due to the blindness of their heart. If we recognize what Paul has said about our growth, it becomes vital to pay attention to the mind. Paul uses five descriptions for those not walking right: only one for their nature, but four for their mind.

At this point, we must ask what part our spirit plays. We have studied our spirit as believers, which is fused entirely with God's spirit. We are one spirit with the Lord and have the life and very nature of God. Our spirit is in a perfect, complete, and divine state, but our mind needs a lot of work because it comes straight out of the world.

## The Tripartite Nature: Spirit, Soul, and Body

We proceed to see a wholesome description of man involving the spirit, mind, and body. First Thessalonians 5:23 and Second Corinthians 4:16 are helpful here. The first text says may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless. The second text tells us that if our outward man perishes, our inward man is renewed day by day.

One text gives three descriptions while the other gives two. The best way to think about man is as a spirit with a mind and a body with a brain. You wouldn't be wrong to say man is a spirit, has a mind, and lives in a body. This is a very accurate way of presenting the case.

Some argue for the spirit automatically having vitality, which is traceable to the word "soul" in Genesis 2:7. When the Lord breathed into man, he became a living soul and came alive with animation. This essence of vitality was put into man and every being God made. You could say the frameworks of spirit and body exist, but they require vitality.

## Understanding the Spirit of the Mind

We must understand that "spirit" is essentially a word for wind, describing invisible realities that have visible effects. Meanwhile, "soul" is a word for breath, speaking to the vitality that brings about animations and activities. We could call a person a "soul" to describe the entire vital being, but we can't say that for the spirit because man has a visible body.

There are things we could use the word "spirit" for that don't refer to the inward man. For example, our work is caused by a particular aspect of our mind that can be called "spirit" because its reality doesn't end with the mind; it produces visible effects. While some realities like memory stay in the mind, the "spirit of the mind" acts in a vital manner.

This is where you see Paul saying that Timothy and he have the same soul or are of kindred spirit. He uses the word *isosukus*, which means equal soul or equal vitality. Having cleared our picture of the reality of man, we must ask what exactly makes up man's mind. Paul spoke of the futility of the mind, darkened understanding, and the blinding of the minds of those who do not believe.

## Reasoning, Enlightenment, and Transformation

We previously noted that the renewing of the mind in Romans 12:2 is what allows us to prove the good and acceptable will of God. Information alone does not transform us; it enlightens us. Therefore, what is being renewed in the mind cannot be the reasoning part or memory alone. There is something deeper in the mind being renewed.

In Luke 24:45, after the resurrection, the Lord opened the disciples' understanding so they could comprehend the scriptures. The word "understanding" used there is the same word for "mind." He was bringing the truth to their minds, making it clear so they could finally get an enlightenment of the things already written in the scriptures.

This is very similar to Ephesians 1:18, where it says the eyes of your understanding are enlightened. There is an aspect of the mind that deals with reasoning and information, but there is more to it than that. Our time is running out for this episode, but we will start to see the other aspects of the mind in the next one. See you there.
