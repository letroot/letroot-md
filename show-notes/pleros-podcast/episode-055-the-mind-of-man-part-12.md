# The Mind of Man (Part 12)

Our journey began by recognizing that God's purpose for us is sonship, where we walk as His children and heirs in fellowship with His nature and character. To carry out our natural and spiritual assignments, we must understand how this purpose unfolds through our daily devotional life and the roadmap of discipleship.

## The Necessity of Spiritual Preparation

Having a roadmap for your life does not guarantee that you will fulfill God's purpose. There is a vital need for discipleship, the perfecting of the saints, and the strengthening required to bear the burden of purpose. Knowing the route and the turns to make is not enough; one must have the spiritual fuel to run the race. This spiritual growth and preparation is precisely why we are studying the mind of man today.

As Jesus taught, it is not enough to simply know God's will; we must prepare and act according to that will. This preparation is the process of spiritual growth that enables us to fulfill our calling. We have been focusing on Ephesians 4:17, where Paul explains that our walk must change as a result of the work of the church. We should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles do, specifically in the futility of their minds.

Paul provides four descriptions of why the natural man walks in futility, with a repeated emphasis on the state of the mind. He notes that their understanding is darkened and they are alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance and blindness within them. This blindness is often like wearing a blindfold; it is not a lack of physical sight, but rather being overwhelmed by falsehood and contrary information. In its natural state, our minds are designed to see truth, but they can become hardened or clogged by the barrage of this world.

We must be careful because, as long as we are in this world, there is a constant influence that can overwhelm our minds. Even if we intellectually disagree with certain ideas, a constant barrage can blind us to truths affecting our walk and the reality of who we are. Paul emphasizes the mind's crucial role in understanding the reality of man as a whole entity.

## Understanding the Inward Man and Reasoning

Scripture describes man as spirit, soul, and body, or as the outward and inward man according to 2 Corinthians 4:16. We can understand man as a spirit with a mind who also possesses a body with a brain. While these parts are codependent, we must place a serious premium on the inward man, which Paul describes as the true self compared to the "tent" of the body. Understanding this distinction helps us unlock how we grow spiritually and how our minds function within our spiritual nature.

In the New Testament, the Greek word *nous* is often used to describe the mind or understanding, specifically regarding our reasoning. For example, in Luke 24:45, Jesus opened the disciples' minds so they could comprehend the scriptures. Their reasoning had previously been closed to a particular grasp of the word, but His explanation made the unseen clear. This reasoning part of the mind is where we process observations, ruminate on information, and store things in our memory.

## From Information to Spiritual Conviction

There is a difference between having information in your memory and having it as a conviction in your mind. You might have been raised with certain worldviews that you still remember, but you no longer hold them to be true. Through reasoning and pondering the evidence, you arrived at a conclusion that those views were incorrect. This is similar to how you know that 2+2 equals 4; you don't need to re-think it every time because you have already reached a firm conclusion.

This process happens frequently in Bible study as we examine scriptural data and interpret it through reasoning. Eventually, you arrive at a conclusion you believe to be true based on sufficient evidence, and this becomes a stored conviction. The Greek word *dianoia* often refers to this faculty of the mind where you have "known through" to a specific conclusion. This is the "enlightened understanding" mentioned in Ephesians 1:18, representing the truths you have fully agreed to.

It is important to realize that you can agree with certain truths in God's word but still not be walking in them. You might intellectually accept that you are a new creation, a loved being in Christ, and the righteousness of God. You can even explain the reasoning behind these truths because they are part of your convictions. However, there is often a gap between knowing these realities and actually living them out in your daily life.

In our next episode, we will explore why this disconnect exists. We will examine why someone who holds these convictions might still struggle to walk in the fullness of their identity.
