# Faith Stand (Part 6)

Welcome back to the Pleros Podcast. This is your daily dose of God's word, transforming you to fulfill God's purpose for your life. It is our passion to ensure you are equipped with everything you need from scripture to walk the path God has set for you.

We have established that fulfilling God's purpose requires capacity, strength, and endurance—qualities built through spiritual growth. This growth happens in the mind. While our spirit is perfect, our mind is the arena where transformation occurs. Understanding the mind's role is critical because reasoning alone does not account for growth; it is merely the consideration of facts. True growth engages the "reckoning" or consciousness aspect of the mind.

## Reckoning and Presenting

Romans 6 teaches us that knowing the truth is not enough; we must "reckon" ourselves to be who God says we are. A believer can know the truth yet fail to walk in it because they are not actively reckoning or presenting themselves in alignment with that truth. This disconnect characterizes the "hearer only" described in James—someone who agrees with the word but does not affirm it.

Colossians 2:6 gives us the pattern for this walk: "As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him." We received Him by faith, and therefore, we must walk by faith. This brings us to the challenge of understanding faith as a "stand." As Paul writes in 2 Corinthians 1:24, "for by faith you stand." Similarly, in 1 Thessalonians 3:8, he says, "For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord," linking their stability directly to their faith.

Without faith, our reckoning is poor. We might know the truth, but if we do not "stand" in it by faith, we will not experience the reality of it in our daily walk.

## The Principle of Faith: Heart and Mouth

Faith operates on a twofold principle: it is in the heart and in the mouth. The heart agrees with and believes the truth exposed to it—such as the reality of our new creation in Christ. But agreement alone is not enough; it must be coupled with acceptance.

James 2:19 notes that even demons believe—they agree that God exists—but they do not have saving faith because they do not accept Him. Believing involves both agreement and acceptance. When you truly accept the truth for yourself, confession becomes the natural, vital expression of that acceptance. You affirm with your mouth what you have believed in your heart.

## Confession as Affirmation

This principle applies not just to salvation but to our daily walk as new creations. When you learn that you are dead to sin and alive to God, you agree with it. But for that truth to transform your life, you must affirm it. It must become your confession, your worship, and your prayer.

Colossians 2:7 describes this process: "rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving." Here, thanksgiving is the affirmation. You are rooted in the knowledge (conviction), but you abound—you become fruitful—through thanksgiving.

If your mouth is silent, your conviction remains dormant. You cannot see transformation in your consciousness without affirmation. This is why Romans 12:1 calls "presenting your bodies" your reasonable service or worship—it is a vital part of your prayer life.

## Aligning Prayer with Identity

Jesus taught us to pray to avoid entering temptation (Mark 14:38). Paul echoes this in Romans 6, telling us to "present" ourselves as instruments of righteousness to avoid sin. These are two sides of the same coin. Prayer that is devoid of this reckoning—prayer that does not affirm who you are in Christ—is empty.

Effective prayer involves standing fast in your identity. It involves the reinforcement of who you are. This can happen through specific affirmation or by praying in the Spirit, which edifies and builds you up (1 Corinthians 14:4).

You must be deliberate about this reinforcement. The world constantly reinforces its own reality; as believers, we must actively reinforce our reality in Christ through the abundance of our hearts and the confession of our mouths. Stay in faith, and keep walking in His purpose.
