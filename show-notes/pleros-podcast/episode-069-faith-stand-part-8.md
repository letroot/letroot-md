# Faith Stand (Part 8)

## Summary
Pastor Akim distinguishes between [[Saving Faith]] (a one-time agreement/acceptance of truth) and [[Faith Stand]] (a continuous, persistent stance that transforms character and experience). He explores the concept of spiritual "reckoning" or "consciousness," arguing that believers must actively maintain a consciousness of redemption rather than sin or fear. The episode concludes by examining the principle of persistence in faith, using the Parable of the Friend at Midnight ([[Luke 11]]) to illustrate unashamed insistence on God's power.

## Key Insights
*   **Two Kinds of Faith**: [[Saving Faith]] is a one-time acceptance of Christ's work, while [[Faith Stand]] is a continuous, persistent agreement with truth that produces experiential results (healing, character change).
*   **Reckoning as Consciousness**: The Greek concept of "reckoning" (*logizomai*) is akin to **consciousness**. A believer's "reckoning" should be dominated by redemption, not [[Sin Consciousness]] or fear of idols/evil spirits.
*   **The Power of Persistence**: Analyzes [[Luke 11]] (The Friend at Midnight). Faith is not just polite agreement but "importunity"—an unashamed, persistent insistence ("shamelessly like I'm very sure this will be done").
*   **Presenting Your Body**: Discusses [[Romans 12:1]]. "Presenting" is an act of affirmation in prayer/worship, aligning one's consciousness with their separated, holy status in Christ.

## Coach's Corner
Building a SaaS isn't just about the "launch" ([[Saving Faith]]); it's about the "grind" ([[Faith Stand]]). Just as a believer must maintain a "consciousness" of redemption to avoid anxiety, a founder must maintain a "conviction" of their product's value to survive the "trough of sorrow." The "importunity" in [[Luke 11]] is exactly like the relentless resourcefulness needed when your server crashes at 3 AM or a key deal stalls—you don't stop knocking until you get the result.

## Action Items
*   [ ] **Audit your consciousness**: Identify areas where you have "imposter syndrome" or "failure consciousness" instead of "success reckoning."
*   [ ] **Practice "Importunity"**: Apply the "Friend at Midnight" persistence to a current blocker—don't accept "no" or "later" from vendors or stubborn bugs.
