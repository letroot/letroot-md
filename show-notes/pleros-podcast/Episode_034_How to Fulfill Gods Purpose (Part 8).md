## Fulfilling Our Natural Assignment

Welcome back to the Pleros podcast, your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. We are looking at an important factor: how do we fulfill God's purpose? We have already seen that God's purpose for our lives is sunship, which is to be His child and His heir. For our natural assignment, we start where we are, take advantage of opportunities, use this world without misusing it, and remain open to the leading of the Spirit.

Lastly, we must be maximally productive. The instruction of God's word regarding our natural assignment is for us to be diligent. Whether in Ecclesiastes, Proverbs, or the epistles, we see a repeated call for diligence. We must take our natural assignments seriously because they are a meaningful part of what we were made to do.

The gospel gives us a sense of purpose and confidence that our labor is valuable. With the assurance that this is about God's purpose for our lives, we can commit to our assignments with all dedication. This foundation allows us to pursue the tasks at hand without being easily shaken.

## Engaging in the Spiritual Assignment

Beyond the natural, we have a vital spiritual assignment. Because we are born of God, His Spirit is at work in us to will and to do of His good pleasure, giving us the desire to propagate the gospel. One of the first ways to put that desire to work is through prayer. We pray for God's kingdom to be manifest on earth and for the light of the gospel to reach those in darkness. 

There is so much contradiction and evil in the world that can only be solved through the redemption found in Jesus. It is not just by behavioral modification that people are made right; they need the gospel. Therefore, we should pray for the spread of the gospel and combat the darkness spread by the enemy.

In addition to prayer, we should preach and publicize the gospel by every means available, both online and offline. Whether it is sharing a tract, a flyer, or content on social media, we use our virtual presence to reflect our faith. While we fulfill our natural duties during the workday, we should also show up virtually as people who share the heart of the gospel and the need for salvation.

## Developing Spiritual Stature

To fulfill these assignments effectively, we must focus on how to grow. What does it take for us to get to the point where we are as effective as we ought to be? Consider the example of someone meant to carry heavy loads; if they lack the stature, they must hit the gym and build themselves up through training. 

It is the same with God’s purpose. When we recognize the weight of what we are called to do, we must realize that we need training, discipline, and discipleship. The Bible describes this as the "perfecting of the saints" in Ephesians chapter 4. We need to be perfected until we come to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God.

Paul explains that we must reach the "measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ." This process requires knowledge, but that knowledge must ultimately produce a stature within us. This development makes it possible for us to do precisely what the Lord would have us do.

## The Role of the Mind in Growth

The focal point of this growth is the mind. Ephesians 4 highlights that the mind of the believer is the issue, contrasting the new creation with the futility and ignorance of a darkened understanding. Without the light of God, the understanding is darkened and the heart is blind to reality.

The truth we find in Christ is what should occupy our minds. While we learn many things about the person of Christ and the nature of redemption, all of this knowledge must terminate in the reality of the new creation. If these truths do not lead to a realization of who we are in Christ, they will not produce a tangible walk.

We need all of these truths to give us stability and certainty in what we believe. However, the knowledge of who we are is the prerequisite to our growth. It is one thing to know who we are, but it is another thing to grow in the light of that knowledge and walk in it.

## Reckoning and Transformation

In Romans 6, Paul clarifies that knowing our identity is only the beginning. He asks if we should continue in sin, noting that Christ did not just forgive us but took us out of the reign of sin entirely. Because we died to sin, we are no longer under its authority or domain, and this should affect our conduct.

Paul emphasizes that we must know these truths, but then he introduces the concept of reckoning. In Romans 6:11, he instructs us to reckon ourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. This reckoning is a step beyond simple intellectual knowledge; it is a way of processing the truth.

This leads us to the idea of presenting ourselves and renewing our minds as seen in Romans 12. Transforming to fulfill God's purpose requires that our minds are renewed so that we can be transformed. We will explore what it means to reckon, present, and be transformed in our next episode.
