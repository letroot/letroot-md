# The Mind of Man (Part 15)

Welcome to the Plerose podcast, your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. We have been looking at the mind of man, specifically focusing on how God’s purpose is sonship. This means He wants us to be His children and His heirs, called to a daily walk in fellowship with His nature and character. Essentially, our entire life is to be lived for the Lord, encompassing everything from family and academics to our spiritual assignments.

## Bearing the Weight of God’s Purpose

With an understanding of God’s purpose, you are able to walk the way He desires, but there is still a significant issue to address. It is one thing to have the knowledge of the roadmap, but it is another thing to know how to bear the weight and the burden of that purpose. Purpose is not just going on a journey; it involves carrying certain responsibilities in your natural and spiritual assignments. This reality brought us to the study of discipleship and the perfection of the saints.

We saw that the perfection of the saints takes place in our mind because our spirit is already entirely changed at salvation. In our spirit, we are one with Christ, and there is nothing missing or lacking in that nature. However, there is a question of whether our mind has matched up in growth to the realities of our spirit. Your mind is essentially your life, and the state of your walk is a direct reflection of the state of your mind.

## Cleaning the Slate of the Mind

Before salvation, your mind was influenced by the flesh, worldliness, and the contradictions of sin and death. Because we live in a world under the bondage of sin, its influence imposes itself on the mind of man. This means we have "double work" at the point of salvation. You are not just starting from a clean slate by adding knowledge; you are starting from a slate that needs to be cleaned up and rearranged.

The mind of man has several distinct aspects, beginning with reasoning. When someone speaks to you, the first part of your mind thinks about and weighs what they said. If you are undecided, that information stays in the reasoning zone while you experiment or think through the subject matter. This immediate conscious reasoning is the gateway through which all new information must pass.

## Reasoning, Memory, and the Will

The second aspect of the mind is memory, which God's word acknowledges in the account of Lazarus and the rich man. Abraham told the rich man to remember the things he enjoyed in his lifetime, showing that memory persists. Once you conclude a matter after reasoning through it, the information moves from memory into the third part of the mind: the will. Your free will allows you to agree or disagree with a claim based on the evidence available to you.

The fourth aspect is conviction, which is the state of having arrived at a settled conclusion. Once you have a conviction, you might not always remember every detail of the reasoning that led you there, but you remain sure of the result. You can hold onto a conviction and live by it even if you cannot explain the logic at a moment's notice. Conviction is a real, separate part of our mind that we arrive at via reasoning or sometimes emotions.

## The Central Power of Consciousness

The final and most central part of the mind is what we call the state of reckoning, or consciousness. This aspect is profound because, as James implies, you do not do what you know; you do what you are conscious of. You could have heard the word and agreed with it, but if it is not your present reckoning, you will not act on it. Your actions follow your passive state of consciousness—the way you have always thought about yourself.

Your emotions and your conscience judgment also follow this consciousness rather than your convictions. For example, a person who knows they are a new creation may still react in anger because their old consciousness remains active. To walk in the supernatural or in character, you must grow by reckoning yourself as who you truly are in Christ. In the next episode, we will look closer at how this consciousness and faith interplay to transform our daily walk.
