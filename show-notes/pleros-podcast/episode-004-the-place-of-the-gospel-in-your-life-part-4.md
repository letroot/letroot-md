# The Place of the Gospel in your Life (Part 4)

We continue our discussion on the place of the gospel in your life. Our aim is to help you understand the gospel not merely as a one-time event of salvation. While you may initially perceive it this way, having recently grasped the reality of redemption fulfilled in Christ Jesus, we will now delve into its deeper implications.

As a brief recap, the gospel declares itself to be truth. Ephesians 1:13 states, "You trusted after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation." If the gospel is indeed truth, it implies two fundamental principles: it is always correct, and no action can ultimately undermine it, only reinforce its power. Even when one acts against it, the truth prevails, leading to negative consequences for the opponent, just as it brings positive outcomes for those who align with it.

## The Reality of the New Creation

If the gospel is truth, we must examine its claims and observe their validity. How do we ascertain truth? We confirm it through observation and reason, just as we would any other fact—whether verifying someone's height or a specific measurement. Observation and reason provide the means to know for sure what is true.

Previously, we established the reality of God through observation and reason. Given the finite and contingent nature of our world, there must be a cause that is equal to or greater than creation itself, which is God. We then explored the reality of redemption, evidenced by the inherent contradictions within the world. Our current focus is on a third truth proclaimed by the gospel: the reality of the new creation.

The gospel declares that once saved by the redemptive work accomplished by the Lord Jesus, you become a completely new creation. You have been rescued from death and darkness. This signifies a profound transformation within you, personally effected by Christ's victory over sin, death, and darkness.

## From Darkness into Light

This redemptive work is being fulfilled in stages, and the initial stage is realized within each believer. The complete defeat of sin and death will culminate at the consummation of redemption, upon the Lord's return, when creation itself will be freed from these effects. However, the immediate implication of redemption is fulfilled in us; those who have believed have already received the righteousness of God.

Scripture clarifies this transformation, particularly in Ephesians 5:8, regarding light and darkness. It states, "You were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; therefore, walk as children of light." This signifies a fundamental change in our nature. It is vital to distinguish this from those who claim to be light based on their own premises, divorced from the gospel. Such claims, when contrasted with the world's inherent contradictions, are simply not true.

In John 5:24, the Lord Jesus affirms that whoever hears His words and believes possesses eternal life and will not face judgment. He declares, "You have passed from death to life." The moment you believe in Jesus, this transition is not a gradual process; it has already occurred. Colossians 1:13 further confirms that God "has delivered us from the authority of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of His beloved Son."

## The Work of the Spirit

It is crucial to recognize the strong emphasis on the reality of the new creation. Something profound has changed within you; the old nature of flesh and darkness is eradicated. While you might still find yourself grappling with thoughts or actions that suggest you are the same person, we will address that later. For now, grasp the truth: if anyone is in Christ, they are a new creation.

According to 1 Corinthians 12:13, "By one Spirit we were all baptized into one body." You entered "in Christ" through the Spirit of God placing you into the body of Christ. Becoming a new creation means old things have entirely passed away. This isn't a work in progress; regarding your nature, you are already completely as Christ is.

When the Bible states that old things have passed away, it means all of them. This is why all things have become new, and all things are of God. At salvation, nothing in the natural realm visibly changed—your physical body remains the same. However, this is because we often view ourselves in only one dimension. Humanity possesses a dual reality that we must examine to understand God's ultimate purpose.

## The Inward and Outward Man

In 2 Corinthians 4:16, Paul distinguishes between the outward and inward man, stating that "though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day." The outward man refers to your body, which ages and decays. The inward man, your spirit, never ages. Paul highlights this distinction between the decaying physical "tent" and the inward man, which became entirely new the moment you believed the gospel.

Your inward man, formerly the "old man" or the flesh, is now completely gone. It was once darkness and death, but it is now entirely light and life. This truth needs to be deeply embedded in your heart: you are new by the Spirit of God. We will pause our discussion of the new creation here as we transition towards understanding God's purpose.

## Discovering God's Purpose

What is God's purpose? Why do you exist on earth? Why do you possess life and breath? We find ourselves here, often without understanding our origin. Then, as we mature, we begin to question the meaning of our existence in this world.

I recall reaching that point myself, wondering how I even arrived here. Following the chain of birth back, I eventually considered God and pondered who created Him. My mind sought to grasp the ultimate purpose. Sometimes we receive vague answers, such as following our passions or hunger, but such answers lack objective foundation.

We need to discover the truth about why we exist. To create your own purpose while disregarding God's is a form of idolatry. If God created the world, He did so for His own purpose. To determine your own purpose is to usurp His place as God. There is an objective answer to God's purpose, and this objective answer is our focus.
