# How to Fulfill God's Purpose (Part 3)

We have been exploring how to fulfill God's purpose. We began by understanding the reality of God's purpose: sunship, which means being both His child and His heir. As His children, we pursue His purpose through regular, daily devotional fellowship with Him. As His heirs, we have two assignments: a natural assignment and a spiritual assignment, each with a distinct journey.

Having outlined this journey, we now turn to the crucial question: How do we actually fulfill God's purpose? Consider the example of someone tasked with carrying two bags of cement, one in each hand, for 500 meters without dropping either. Upon assessing their current capacity, they might realize, "I can't do this now, but I can train and prepare myself to accomplish it." This individual would then go to the gym, undergo training, and build the necessary strength and endurance to bear the weight for the required distance and duration.

This preparation is vital. It is not enough to simply know what you are meant to do or to understand the exact terms and path of your assignment. You must build the capacity to execute it. You must prepare to do what the Lord has called you to do.

## The Mandate for Preparation

Recall the words of Jesus in Luke 12. He stated that "He that knows my will and does not prepare and do according to my will will receive a harsher judgment." He describes this as being "beaten with many stripes," signifying a greater loss of reward in the age to come. This person will be at a severe disadvantage for failing to prepare and act. In contrast, for the one who "did not know yet did things deserving of stripes," the judgment will be "few." While there are still losses, they are not as grave as for the one who knew God's will but neglected preparation.

Now that we know God's purpose, preparation becomes paramount for its fulfillment. A key text that illuminates the preparation needed is Ephesians chapter 4. We have referenced this text before for other reasons, but this time, our focus is specifically on preparation for God's purpose.

In Matthew 28, Jesus instructed His apostles to "make disciples of every nation." Luke 6:40 elaborates on discipleship, stating, "A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who is perfectly trained will be like his teacher." If the apostles were to make disciples, it meant they were to perfect people to become like the Master. The word "perfect" used in Luke 6:40 is closely related to the term found in Ephesians 4:12, where it refers to the ongoing process of discipleship that believers undergo to fulfill God's purpose for their lives.

## The Role of Church Leadership in Perfecting Saints

Let us delve into Ephesians 4, starting with verse 11: "And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers." Regardless of how one interprets these roles – whether as distinct responsibilities or as manifestations within one individual – they represent the leaders Christ gave to the church.

Ephesians 4:12 continues, "for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ." It is crucial to distinguish between the two instances of the word "for." The first "for" (Greek: *pros*) means "towards" or "with a view to" the perfection of the saints. The second "for" (Greek: *eis*) means "into" or "unto." This implies that when we are perfected as saints, it leads *into* the work of ministry (our spiritual assignment), and subsequently *unto* the building up of the body of Christ. The apostle Paul further explains this from verse 13 to 16, detailing the logical consequence of perfected saints engaging in their assignments, which naturally builds Christ's body.

The word "perfecting" in Ephesians 4:12 in the Greek is *katartismos*. This term is derived from two words: *kata*, meaning "downwards" or "down," and *artios*, which signifies a "completion point" or "fitting together." *Artios* is also used in 2 Timothy 3:17, where it describes the man of God as being "perfect" or "complete" through scripture. Verse 16 of 2 Timothy 3 states that "all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness," leading to the completion point where the man of God is *artios*.

Bringing this back to Ephesians 4:12, Christ gave leaders for the *katartismos* of the saints—for bringing the saints to a completion or perfection point, to an end point where they are complete and fit for purpose. As they are brought to this point, they undertake their assignments, particularly their spiritual assignment, performing the work of ministry and edifying the body of Christ.

## The Twin Ambitions: Growth and Purpose

Why is this explanation of *katartismos* so significant? Because Ephesians 4:13 clarifies what this "completion point" entails: "till we all come to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ." This verse defines the end point that saints are meant to reach to effectively carry out their assignments.

This reveals two fundamental ambitions that should govern our lives: a goal of growth and a goal of purpose. To accomplish the tasks the Lord has called us to—to fulfill our divine assignment—we must reach a specific point in our spiritual growth. This is a precise point of *artios*, where we are exactly as we should be, much like the analogy of training in the gym to become fit enough to bear specific burdens. The church, therefore, is charged with the ambition of bringing us to this particular point of maturity and helping us maintain that stature so we can consistently do what we are meant to do.

Before we delve deeper into the specific descriptions of this desired state in Ephesians 4:13, let us consider Colossians chapter 1, which echoes this same burden of reaching a specific goal in spiritual growth. Understanding this goal illuminates the relevance of all that the church teaches and does.

## Paul's Pursuit of Perfection

In Colossians 1:24, Paul declares, "Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ, for the sake of His body, which is the church." One might initially react strongly to the idea of anything being "lacking" in Christ's work, but Paul clarifies his statement. What is lacking is not Christ's accomplished work itself, but the *knowledge* of it. The reality of His achievements and the nature we have received through Him exist, but without the knowledge of these truths, they cannot benefit us.

Imagine someone with an inheritance worth billions, enough for a lifetime, yet they remain oblivious to it. If this person is not made aware of their inheritance, they can never access or benefit from what rightfully belongs to them. Paul views his role as a minister of the gospel as making known the Word of God, thereby filling this gap in knowledge.

He continues in Colossians 1:28, "Him we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus." Here, "perfect" (Greek: *teleios*) again signifies completeness. The preacher's ultimate goal is to see the saint, the hearer of God's Word, arrive at this point of completion. Paul explicitly states this intention: "I want to present every man perfect in Christ Jesus."

Verse 29 further underscores his commitment: "To this end I also labor, striving according to the working of Him who works in me mightily." Paul's unwavering effort is directed toward bringing believers to this desired state of perfection that both he and God long for.

## The Fourfold Goal of God's Purpose

Returning to Ephesians 4:13, what exactly is this specific point that the Lord desires us to reach to fulfill His purpose? How do we fulfill God's purpose? It requires the training, discipleship, and perfecting—the growth—that enables us to bear the weight and burden of our calling.

Ephesians 4:13 provides four distinct descriptions of this vital goal:

1.  **The unity of the faith:** This speaks to a collective and individual understanding and agreement in fundamental Christian truths.
2.  **The knowledge of the Son of God:** This is not merely intellectual assent but a deep, experiential knowledge and intimacy with Christ.
3.  **A perfect man:** This refers to spiritual maturity and completeness.
4.  **The measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:** This describes reaching the full spiritual height and character of Christ Himself.

These descriptions present two overarching categories for our growth: a point in knowledge and a point in spiritual stature. This dual emphasis on understanding and character will be the focus of our exploration in the next discussion.
