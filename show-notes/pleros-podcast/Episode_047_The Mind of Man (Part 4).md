# The Mind of Man (Part 4)

Welcome to the Pleros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Welcome back to the Pleros Podcast. This is your daily dose of God's word, transforming you to fulfill God's purpose for your life. Presently, we're looking at the mind of man, which is such an important teaching. We have been able to introduce the subject matter to a very good degree, seeing what God's purpose is regarding sonship and our assignments as heirs.

We have proceeded from that to see the roadmap for the pursuit of God's purpose. This unfolds through a daily life of devotion where our natural and spiritual assignments are revealed. However, having the knowledge of what God's purpose is and even seeing the roadmap will not cut it. We need to actually fulfill it and bear the burden, which is where we see the need for growth.

## The Necessity of Spiritual Growth

Speaking of the need for growth, we saw the Lord instructed discipleship and explained in Luke 6:40 that discipleship is to perfect people to be as the master. This is a word that Paul picked up on in Ephesians 4, stating that the church leadership is given for the perfecting of the saints for the work of ministry. God's purpose requires growth, and we must identify where this growth happens.

In Ephesians 4:17, we are told that this growth happens in the mind. After Paul talked about the church's role to perfect us as saints where we come to end points in knowledge and stature, he makes it clear that all of this is occurring in the mind. When we talk about growing up spiritually, we must be looking at what is happening to our mind, not what is happening to our spirit.

Our spirit cannot be improved upon. The moment a man is born again, the change that had to happen to the spirit has happened once and for all. While we might use the word "spirit" loosely in common semantics to describe someone's strength, spiritual growth is fundamentally a mind thing. It is essential to establish this point clearly: your spirit is in a perfect, complete, and divine state.

## The Perfection of the Recreated Spirit

Our spirit is exactly as Christ. Recall Romans 8:15, where we see that you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but the spirit of sonship whereby we cry, "Abba, Father." God has given us His Spirit, and He gave it so much so that it is entirely fused with our spirit. Therefore, the testimony of these two spirits is identical.

Verse 16 says the Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God. These two spirits are fused as one and have the exact same testimony. This would mean that if there is no improvement to happen to the Spirit of God, there is no improvement to happen to our spirit. We cannot add more to our spirit than it already has.

As 1 Corinthians 6:17 states, "he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit." When you are joined to the Lord, you are one spirit with Him, meaning there is no difference between your spirit and His Spirit. They are fused together as one. While we possess our own spirit, its reality is that it has been united with God's Spirit in a permanent union.

## Understanding the Divine Nature

In 1 Thessalonians 5:23, Paul prays that your "whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless." We must not quickly assume that the soul is the mind, as the word "soul" specifically refers to vitality and animation. While we will address the soul later, we know that for those who have received the gospel, our spirit is fused with God's Spirit.

1 John 3:24 explains that he who keeps His commandments abides in God and God in him. We know He abides in us by the Spirit whom He has given us. God’s dwelling in us is by His Spirit, which is fused with our own. We can speak of them as two realities, but in the context of our nature, they overlap and function as one.

Because we have been given His Spirit, we cannot improve on what we have, as that would be like trying to improve on God. 2 Peter 1:3-4 makes it clear that His divine power has given us all things pertaining to life and godliness. Through these promises, we have become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption of the world.

## Complete in Christ

The word "partaker" comes from the root *koinos*, which simply means "common." When we say we are partakers of the divine nature, it means we have the divine nature in common with God. This is not pantheism; it is Christianity. God wanted us as His children and gave us His nature, though our status remains that of the created rather than the self-existent Creator.

We cannot get "more" nature, but we are called to grow in that nature. The nature itself is fixed and permanent because God's Spirit is in you. There is no improvement possible for the reality of "the greater one" who dwells within you. However, there is a significant place for growth that must occur within our thinking.

Colossians 2:9-10 notes that in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and you are complete in Him. You are not having just a part or portion of it; you are complete in this reality. While there is no improving on our spirit, there is a lot of work to do on our mind. In the next episode, we will start to see the different things that make up the mind of man.
