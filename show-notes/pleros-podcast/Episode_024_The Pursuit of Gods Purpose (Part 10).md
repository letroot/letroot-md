# The Pursuit of God's Purpose (Part 10)

We continue our exploration into the pursuit of God's purpose. We have previously established that God's purpose centers on sonship, meaning He desires us to be His children and, by extension, His heirs.

As children of God, we are called to walk in fellowship with Him, reflecting His nature and character. However, if purpose were limited to just this, one might wonder, "What is the ultimate point?" This question is not unusual; it stems from a fundamental human disposition, acknowledged by Scripture, that we are wired for more than mere existence.

It is a necessary and positive inclination to seek a divine calling. You are called by God to do something specific, and this is where the deeper reality of sonship truly emerges, defining our identity as sons of God. The term "son" in this context does not solely denote a male child but signifies one positioned to manage and oversee the inheritance of another. Culturally, this responsibility was historically entrusted to the male child, often the firstborn.

Consider the example from Exodus 4, where the Lord instructed Moses to tell Pharaoh, "Let my people go; Israel is my firstborn." Here, "firstborn" refers to the entire nation of Israel, encompassing both males and females. The essence of being a "firstborn" in this biblical sense is about being an heir. This concept is further elaborated and clarified by the apostles in the New Testament.

In this spiritual sense, you too can declare, "I am God's firstborn," because you possess His inheritance. While an earthly inheritance typically passes to the firstborn, who then assumes leadership, our focus here is simply on our status as God's heirs. In the ultimate sense, our Lord Jesus is the true "Firstborn" and head of all people. We are joint heirs with Him, and through Him, each of us can embrace the spiritual reality of being God's "firstborn."

## The Urgency of Spiritual Assignments

We have been examining the pursuit of our assignments, both natural and spiritual. Our discussion on natural assignments covered five key areas: starting where you are, leveraging opportunities, pursuing your desires, being open to the Spirit's leading, and maximizing productivity. We recognized that being maximally productive is integral to God's purpose, as our natural work is part of our inheritance.

Now, we shift our focus to the core of spiritual assignments. It is crucial that we fully explore, understand, and commit to our spiritual calling, as it is an easily neglected aspect of our lives. Neglect often arises because our immediate survival seems dependent on the natural world, making it highly probable that we will engage in natural activities regardless of whether we perceive them as God-given.

A spiritual assignment, however, operates differently. It requires conviction – a deep understanding of its value and a commitment born out of that recognition. The very presence of our Lord Jesus should compel our hearts to embrace our spiritual assignment immediately upon salvation. Before Christ, our earthly pursuits, though necessary for survival, were undertaken under the bondage of sin and death, ultimately leading to eternal damnation.

We were saved from this by the Lord's redemptive work, a privilege made possible through the mission of the Church and the preaching of the Gospel. Therefore, we must awaken to the profound seriousness of this spiritual work. It demands our complete attention, dedication, and priority. Our hearts must be rightly aligned with our spiritual assignments.

## The Role of Discipleship and the Local Church

If your heart is disconnected from what the Lord is doing and the spiritual tasks He has given you, you are not functioning as a co-laborer with Him. As 2 Corinthians 6:1 implies, this carries unfortunate implications on multiple levels. It is regrettable that the Lord sacrificed so much to enable our participation, only for us to neglect our part. It is equally unfortunate for those around you who remain in darkness, whom you could have helped with the truth of God's word.

For some, this hesitation stems from fear; for others, sadly, it is shame or even a misplaced sense of superiority, believing such a noble task is beneath them. This indicates a misunderstanding of the profound privilege involved. As we delve into the Scriptures on this topic, I trust you will discover that spiritual assignment is neither overly difficult nor beyond your reach. You may find that any reluctance you feel is merely the insidious seeds of the enemy sown in your heart.

A critical point to remember is that when the Lord instructed His apostles, He intended for them to disciple others to carry out the same commands. He commissioned them to "go and make disciples of all nations, teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you." This clearly shows that the discipleship process within the church is what equips us for the spiritual assignment of ministry.

The proper approach to our spiritual assignment begins with discipleship immediately following salvation. After you are saved, you need to be discipled, and this process is primarily facilitated within a local church. Do not delay this step. Begin in a local church with your current level of understanding. As your understanding grows, if a better alignment with your convictions is necessary, you can make that adjustment.

## Embracing Your Personal Ministry

However, not being part of any local church is detrimental to your spiritual well-being. It hinders the sense of community and relationship that the Lord desires for you. The Bible places great emphasis on conscience, and acting contrary to your conscience is considered sin. If your conscience is not prompting you toward local church involvement, this indicates an area needing correction. Once you recognize the necessity of being in a local church, your spiritual growth will accelerate.

What truly matters is your genuine interest in pursuing God's purpose as He intends. This commitment requires you to receive the training and equipping offered by the local church to help you fulfill that purpose. Ephesians 4:11 states that Christ gave leaders to the church "to equip the saints for the work of ministry." You have a spiritual assignment, and discipleship is its foundational first step.

The very message of salvation you received is the initial phase of your discipleship. You can, in turn, share that same message with others, even if your communication skills are still developing. Once you are rooted in a local church and actively being discipled, you are firmly on the path to fulfilling your spiritual assignments. In fact, your natural assignments should also derive from this spiritual foundation, as it is difficult to approach your natural work with the right spirit outside the context of the local church.

Consider Paul: immediately after his conversion, he was aware of his ministry. He was discipled among the apostles, receiving teaching, and began preaching without delay from the moment he was saved. This should be our disposition: commit to discipleship and begin serving where you are.
