# The Pursuit of God's Purpose (Part 10)

Welcome to Plaro's podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it. 

Brothers and sisters, welcome again to another episode of the Plleos podcast where we serve you your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. All right. So we are looking at the subject matter of the pursuit of God's purpose because we have already seen what God's purpose is. We've seen that it is sonship, which means God wants us to be His child and He wants us to be His heirs. 

## Understanding Our Identity as Heirs

As children of God, we are to walk in fellowship with Him and in His nature and character. But then if that's all there is to purpose, then we're like, "Yeah, I'll just walk with God, and then yeah, so what's the point?" What's supposed to happen? The reason why you are asking the question is not because you're weird or wired differently. It is because that's the ordinary state of reality found with humanity and acknowledged by Scripture. 

It's not a case of something bad; it's in fact something good and very necessary that you have that kind of disposition. You have something that you're called by God to do, and that's where the other reality of sonship comes in, which in fact is what makes us the sons of God. The description is not of a male child, but of one positioned for managing that which is another. This idea at the time, for cultural reasons, was usually a responsibility entrusted to the male child, usually the firstborn. 

Look at the instance we referenced way earlier on in the podcast in Exodus 4, where the Lord said to Moses to tell Pharaoh, "Let my people go; Israel is my firstborn." He was talking about the entire seed of Israel, which includes male and females. The son part is there, but also the firstborn applies to all of them because the idea there is about being an heir. This is now explained, interpreted, and clarified to us by the apostles in the New Testament text. 

You could also say, "I am God's firstborn," because I happen to have His inheritance. Usually, the inheritance of the father will pass to the firstborn, who then gets the leadership over others. The focus here is simply that you are God's heir. If there's any firstborn in this sense, like the head of the people, it is our Lord Jesus. We are joint heirs with Him, and all of us can say in a sense that we are God's firstborn. 

## The Reality of Spiritual Assignments

We have been looking at the pursuit of our assignments, both natural and spiritual. We've already examined the natural, where five things are seen: start where you are, take advantage of opportunities, pursue that which you desire, be open to the leading of the Spirit, and be maximally productive. The issue of being maximally productive is something we saw as far back as the reality of God's purpose, where we saw that our natural work is part of our inheritance. 

Now, let's get back to the base of spiritual assignments. I'm really concerned about us fully exploring, understanding, and being generally convinced of our spiritual assignment because it is an easily neglectable part. It's easily neglectable because your survival depends on things in the natural world. It is very unlikely you would not do things in the natural even if you don't regard it as given to you by God. 

A spiritual assignment is much different; it's by conviction—seeing the value of it and regarding it out of that value—that you are going to commit to it. The very presence of our Lord Jesus ought to shift our hearts to embracing our spiritual assignment immediately from salvation. That is the realization that even if we're trying to survive this world, we are still doing it under the bondage of sin and death leading only to a damnable end. 

Now we are saved by the Lord out of that by the work that He did. It's the privilege of the mission of the church, people preaching the gospel to us, that we get saved. I don't think we should not wake up immediately to that fact that this work is serious. This work deserves all the attention, the dedication, and the priority that it requires. Our heart must be in the right state relative to our spiritual assignment. 

## The Necessity of the Local Church

If you are disconnected at heart from what the Lord is doing and what the Lord has given to you to do in your spiritual assignment, you are not serving as a worker together with Him. 2 Corinthians 6:1 says it's rather unfortunate on several levels. It's unfortunate the Lord sacrificed for us to ensure we do our part and you are not doing that. It's also unfortunate for those who are in your path that you are not helping with the truth of the word to come out of darkness. 

There's usually fear for some people, and unfortunately and sadly, there's usually shame. Some people think of themselves so highly that they think it's beneath them, which is sad because there's something wrong with the mind to think of such a noble task in that manner. I hope that as we pour through Scriptures on this matter, you find that it's not that difficult and is not something away from you. You'll find probably that the reason why you feel all this way is the seeds of the enemy sown on your heart. 

One thing we noticed is when the Lord was giving instruction to the apostles, He had it in mind that they should disciple people to do what He was telling them as well. He told them to go and make disciples of all nations and cause them to observe what He was commanding. This means the discipleship process of the church is what produces us to do that spiritual assignment of ministry. It is the discipleship process that causes us to do that work. 

The proper order of talking about our spiritual assignment is that it starts with discipleship from salvation. Right after you are saved, you need to be discipled, and that is in the local church. You shouldn't put it off; the first thing to do is be in a local church starting with whatever degree of understanding you have. When your understanding grows, if there be the need to align where you are better by your understanding, that is fine. 

## Taking the First Steps in Ministry

But not being in a local church at all is not healthy for you in any way. It's not healthy for the sense of community and relationship the Lord wants you to have. The Bible is very big on conscience, and doing something contrary to where your conscience is at the moment is actually a sin. If your conscience is not aligned with being in a local church, you have a problem that needs to be corrected. Once you know that you need to be in a local church, you start to grow. 

What is important is you are genuinely interested in following God's purpose in the manner that He expects you to. This requires of you receiving the training of the local church and its equipping to help you fulfill that purpose. Ephesians 4:11 says He gave the leaders of the church to perfect the saints to do the work of ministry. You have that spiritual assignment, and the very first step is to be discipled. 

The very message you had at salvation is the first step of your discipleship. That message you can preach to someone else, even if you might not be as effective in communicating it yet. Once you are rooted somewhere and being discipled, you are on track in carrying out your spiritual assignments. In fact, your natural assignment should also be born out of that. You will not likely walk in a right spirit towards your natural assignment without the local church. 

Notice that Paul, right out of his salvation, was aware of his ministry and was discipled still. He was amongst the disciples being taught, and he began preaching immediately from where he was saved. That must be our disposition: be discipled and go from where you are. We'll pick it up from here in the next episode. Thank you.
