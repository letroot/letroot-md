# How to Fulfill God's Purpose (Part 10)

Welcome back to the Pleros podcast. This is your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. We are looking at how to fulfill God's purpose, which begins with understanding that your purpose is sonship. As God’s heir, you have both a natural assignment and a spiritual assignment to fulfill in your daily life. The pursuit of purpose is a journey of regular devotion and fellowship with the Father that facilitates your spiritual growth.

## The Journey of Spiritual Growth and Preparation

This journey happens through discipleship and the "perfecting" of the saints, a process known as *katismos*. This word implies bringing a believer to a specific end-goal of growth and fitness. We hold a dual ambition: the ambition of growth and the ambition of purpose itself. You must develop the stature, strength, and endurance required to bear the burden of the assignment you have been given.

Preparation is essential in carrying out God's purpose. In Luke 12:47-48, the Lord explains that those who know His will but do not prepare accordingly will face consequences. Therefore, we must focus on the ambition of growth, which involves both knowledge and stature. While knowledge is a prerequisite, what truly matters for our actual growth is what we do with that knowledge.

## Bridging the Gap Between Knowledge and Action

It is entirely possible to know something and yet not do it. If you have reached the necessary point in growth or stature, doing what you know will no longer be difficult; it will become natural. If you are not acting on your knowledge, there is a missing link between your understanding and your state of growth. We want to resolve this link to ensure you move faster in your spiritual journey.

Our nature is already settled once we become a new creation in Christ. As we see in Ephesians 4, the truth we need for growth is the reality of this new creation. We must be renewed in the spirit of our minds, putting off the old man and putting on the new man created after God in righteousness. This renewal is what allows our outward walk to match our internal spiritual reality.

## The Reality of the New Creation

In 2 Corinthians 5, Paul explains that we no longer regard anyone according to the flesh or natural standpoint. While we once knew Christ in a natural sense, we now recognize people based on their inward, spiritual state. If anyone is in Christ, they are a new creation where old things have passed away and all things have become new. We must judge spiritually rather than relying on natural standing, gender, race, or class.

Your spirit nature is permanently fixed and perfected, as you are one spirit with the Lord. However, your walk is entirely a product of your mind, which is why the mind is the focus of our growth. While some suggest we believe with our hearts rather than our minds, faith and reckoning happen within specific dynamics of the human mind. You cannot "train" your perfected spirit, but you must renew your mind to reflect that perfection.

## The Power of Reckoning and Presentation

In Romans 6, Paul instructs us to reckon ourselves dead to sin but alive to God. This "reckoning" is an intentional recognition and accounting of your spiritual reality. Your knowledge alone does not produce your work; rather, your reckoning and the act of "putting on" the new man produce your walk. We must move beyond simply knowing the truth to actively accounting for it in our daily lives.

The word "present" in Romans 6:13 comes from the Greek word *paristemi*, which means to "stand beside." When you present yourself to God, you are not creating a new reality but standing beside the reality that already exists in your spirit. You are standing beside your body as one who is dead to sin and alive unto God. This act of presentation is what facilitates true spiritual growth and productivity.

Romans 12:1 beseeches us to present our bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God. You are not trying to become holy; you already are holy, and you must present yourself as such. This is your reasonable service and your spiritual worship. Understanding the different parts of the mind—where knowledge resides versus where presentation happens—is key to fulfilling God's purpose.
