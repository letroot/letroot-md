Welcome to Plaro's podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

All right, welcome back to the Player Rose podcast, your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. We are looking at how to fulfill God's purpose, which is the core of what this podcast is trying to get us to. Everything else we look at after this will be on the foundation of what we are examining in this particular subject matter.

We had to see a couple of things before we got here. We saw the reality of God's purpose, the place of the gospel as truth, and the pursuit of purpose, which is the journey of walking in His will. God's purpose is sonship, and in pursuing that, we maintain a devotional life while understanding our natural and spiritual inheritance as His heirs.

## The Necessity of Preparation

Knowing how purpose unfolds is one thing, but having the capacity to get it done is another. We saw the words of the Lord Jesus in Luke 12 where he spoke of the one who knows the will of the Lord but does not prepare. Before doing, he showed us there is the need to prepare, or else we are beaten with many stripes. We must prepare to do the will of God.

What is that preparation we are meant to have? When God accomplished the work of redemption, He told His apostles to disciple all nations. Discipleship is that required preparation to be able to do the will of God. As Mark 28 says, we are to go therefore and make disciples of all nations.

## Discipleship as the Required Training

In Luke chapter 6, the Lord gives a general principle of discipleship while commenting on the Pharisees. He says that a disciple cannot be above his teacher, but everyone who is perfectly trained will be like his master. This means you cannot exceed the source you are receiving from, but if you receive fully, you will be equal to that source.

The goal of discipleship is to equalize those we have been discipled by. When we are discipling people, we should expect them to match up with us rather than feeling insecure. If someone is going to be exactly as you are, you better be sure people should be the way you are. Paul uses the same concept in Ephesians 4 when he speaks of the perfecting of the saints.

## Reaching the End Point of Growth

The Lord Jesus gave the church leaders—apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers—for the perfecting of the saints. This word, "katismos," comes from the words "kata" and "atios," meaning to bring to a perfect end point or completion. If our preparation for God's purpose involves being perfected, we must understand what that end point is and how we are brought to it.

Verse 13 of Ephesians 4 tells us that end point: until we all come to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God. He describes this single goal as becoming a perfect man, reaching the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. There are two ambitions in the life of the believer: to fulfill purpose and to grow to be able to fulfill purpose.

Consider the example of someone told to carry two heavy bags of cement for a long distance. If you find you are incapable of doing that, the first step is to build yourself to that point. In God's purpose, we must build ourselves and maintain that strength as we carry out our assignments. This end goal is described in terms of both knowledge and growth.

## Understanding the Unity of the Faith

Verse 13 describes the end point in four ways across two categories. The first category is the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God. The second category is becoming a perfect man and reaching the measure of the stature of Christ. While knowledge of the Son of God is straightforward information, the concept of "unity of the faith" can be more complex.

Unity of the faith does not simply mean agreement despite differences; it refers to the message believed. In the context of Ephesians 4, there is a comprehensive message that must be fully taught. As the word "faith" is often used for the message itself, unity here refers to the wholeness of the doctrine being put together. This is consistent with the mentions of knowledge, doctrine, and truth in the surrounding verses.

The framework of God's word is conclusive and has a defined range rather than being open-ended. While the freshness of the word provides new insights, the actual information and doctrine are established. Paul told Timothy he had fully known his doctrine, and Peter spoke of being established in the "present truth." We are called to continue in and be refreshed by what we have already learned and been assured of.

## Growing into the Stature of Christ

Unity of the faith refers to the wholesome body of knowledge of God's word, which makes for the "perfect man." This describes a complete man who is fully developed and no longer a child. The "stature of the fullness of Christ" clearly points toward growth. To fulfill God's purpose, we must grow in knowledge and allow that knowledge to affect our stature.

By receiving the knowledge of God's word completely and experiencing its effect on our growth, we become able to do all that the Lord has for us. There is a Pleros perfecting course specifically designed for this growth. In the next episode, I will open up exactly how we grow in this manner to fulfill God's purpose. Catch you on the next one.
