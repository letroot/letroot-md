# The Place of the Gospel in Your Life (Part 3)

Welcome to the Pleros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Brothers and sisters, welcome to episode three of the Pleros podcast. We're continuing on a very important subject matter: the place of the gospel in your life. We've seen a couple of things already. We've seen that the place of the gospel is not the place you want it to hold, but the place it claims that it holds, which is the place of truth. 

If it says it is truth, then it means it is always right. It means you can do nothing against it, but for it, even what you do against it is still for it, only that is going to have a negative implication. Therefore, if the gospel's place is that of truth, we need to take it very seriously in two ways. One is to know the things it claims to be truth, and two is to see if indeed they are truth.

## The Gospel as the Foundation of Truth

How do you know that something is the truth? It is known by observation and reason. It is the way you know what kind of phone someone is using or what color of shirt someone is wearing. The same way we know truth on any other matter is the very same way the gospel says we can know it to be truth. This is what Paul himself taught as led and directed by God's spirit.

In Ephesians 1:13, it says you trusted in Jesus after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of salvation. In that sense, your faith in the gospel is premised on the fact that it is the truth. We previously looked at Romans chapter 1 to see the very first thing the gospel claims to be truth, which is the reality of God. Paul says he is not ashamed of the gospel because in it, the righteousness and the wrath of God are revealed.

When you believe, you experience the righteousness of God, but when one suppresses the truth, that person experiences the state of the wrath of God. Paul claims that the truth should be quite obvious and evident to them, but they are rejecting it. He gives his evidence and concludes on the reality of God. You can get a more detailed explanation of this from several teachings found on pleros.org or by doing the Pleros Perfecting Course.

## Understanding the Reality of Redemption

If the gospel claims to be truth, it means you need to take every claim it makes seriously so you can align your life with it. What is the second claim that it makes? The second claim it makes is that there is a reality of redemption fulfilled in Christ. This claim is based on what we can observe and reason, which is the fact that we are in a world where there is contradiction.

We are in a world where there is sin, but the challenge is that when we say "sin," people's minds go immediately to human actions. While wrong actions are certainly sin, God's word often uses the term to describe a state or condition of things contrary to what is right and good. For example, when someone is sick, you are making a statement that there is a way the person ought to be, which is healthy.

The condition in question is contrary to what ought to be, and that is something that we can all witness. We are living in a world of contradiction and sin which baffles us because we know there is a God. Think about it: the kind of contradiction we witness is like the difference between sickness and health. There is the original state and then there is the subsequent situation that is the absence of the original.

## The Bondage of a Fallen World

We could use the concept of light and darkness to explain this further. Darkness is not an original reality in itself; it is a reality premised on the fact that there is light first. It is the absence of light that becomes the reality of darkness. The same applies to life and death. It is the absence of life that renders a lizard in a state where it is dead.

Something has gone wrong and has brought in this other reality that is contrary to what originally ought to be. We can think about it conceptually, intuitively, or morally to see that something is wrong with our world. Sometimes we say we are living in a broken world or a fallen world. Many descriptions exist to grapple with the problem of evil, but the fundamental reality remains the same.

The gospel addresses this by showing that you are witnessing a world of sin in need of redemption. Whenever we talk about redemption, people are often focused on their own actions, but that is not the big issue. Before your actions come into play, you are already under the bondage of sin. It is like being born a slave in Israel while under the bondage of the Egyptians; your situation is the issue.

## The Just Solution Through Christ

It is not a guilt that you have inherited or a flaw passed on to you, but a condition of bondage that you need freedom from. Humanity's rejection of God's purpose at its inception plunged the whole of creation into this bondage of sin. The condition requires that you are saved from it. If someone says they know the way out of a prison, you should listen rather than first demanding to know exactly how you got there.

If there is darkness, the only solution is the restoration of light. If there is death, the only thing that can be done is to bring life back into that situation. The problem we are witnessing has one solution: the original light and life that was rejected must be brought back in. This means what we need is God Himself restored back into our world to solve the contradiction.

God has to solve it justly because it was by man's choice that we find this contradiction. This is why the solution is redemption in Christ Jesus—God Himself enters into the problem to bear the consequences. This problem of death and darkness is a degenerative one, leading from mortality to physical death and eventually to a second death. You cannot afford to toy with this degenerative effect or the reality of perishing.

## A Call to Faith and Salvation

You need deliverance from this problem, and that is what the forgiveness of sins is. God became a man in the person of Jesus so that He could justly bear the consequences of the second death on our behalf. He died on the cross to exhaust this consequence and was raised again from the dead by his power of life. This philosophically necessary need for salvation was prophetically promised and found its fulfillment in the person of Jesus.

Anyone who sees this and believes it is saved. The second truth that the gospel claims is the reality of redemption fulfilled in Christ. I want to encourage you that if you have not believed, do so right now. It is as simple as saying, "Lord Jesus, I see I need salvation. I know you have provided it by becoming a man and paying for this mess, and I put my faith in you right now to be saved."
