# How to Fulfill God's Purpose (Part 9)

Welcome to Plaro's podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Welcome back to the Polaros podcast. This is your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. We're presently looking at how to fulfill God's purpose, which we could actually say is looking at spiritual growth. We are realizing that it takes growth to be able to fulfill the purpose that God has for our lives.

## Understanding the Journey of Sonship

To recall, we have already seen that God's purpose is sonship. This means we are children of God as well as heirs of God. As children of God, we are called to walk in fellowship with our father and to walk in his nature and in his character. As heirs of God, he has given us assignments and an inheritance in two categories: a natural assignment and a spiritual assignment. 

The very essence of our life, as we can see directly from scripture, is for us to fulfill that purpose of sonship that God has for us. Now we can speak of the journey and the pursuit of God's purpose, but we have this question to answer: how do we fulfill it? How exactly do we get it done? 

In Luke 12, the Lord said that he who knows his will and does not prepare shall be beaten with many stripes. It is possible to know the will of the Lord and not do it, but importantly, you can start pursuing it without preparation. You are likely to fail because your mind is not renewed or you have not matured spiritually to carry it out in the manner the Lord desires.

## The Necessity of Spiritual Preparation

It takes discipleship to carry out God's purpose for our lives because it is not possible to do it in the strength of the flesh. There is a mistaken assumption that as long as one is productive in a general sense, then they are doing what God wants. However, the fuel of that productivity might be the flesh or worldliness rather than the Spirit of God. 

It is very important that we prize the place of spiritual growth and discipleship to shape and order our lives after the heart of God. The Lord commanded us to preach the gospel, get people saved, and then disciple them to do all he commanded. Paul explained this discipleship as "perfecting the saints," which means bringing them to a specific destination. 

That destination is described in two categories: knowledge and stature. Stature is a word used to describe growth. The stature one has at birth is different from the stature you have at five, ten, or eighteen years old. There is a specific spiritual stature that God wants us to have, and it is a very high set for us.

## Growing into the Fullness of Christ

Ephesians 4 says that by speaking the truth in love, we would all grow into Christ in all things. This text is powerful because it suggests we must grow in every area. We might find individuals who are strong in love but weak in the supernatural, or strong in the supernatural but weak in righteousness. 

To carry a heavy load, such as two bags of cement, one must recognize if they have the necessary fitness and endurance. Rather than dragging the load and struggling, the first thing to do is to set a bar of growth that makes the assignment possible. This is what the Lord desires; he wants us to set that bar of growth so we can carry out his will.

One of the fundamental things we have resolved is that our mind is the seat or zone of growth. While our nature is already changed at salvation, our mind is where we need to do the work. The extent to which we fulfill all that the Lord wants us to do is determined by our minds.

## Renewing the Mind for God's Purpose

Everything we do in our life flows from our minds, yet we often underestimate the influence of our background. We assume that however our mind is currently is just "how it is," but that is not true. Your conditioning before you reached the stage of personal introspection might be filled with mess from the world. 

All of us have something of the flesh to address in our minds because we live in a world where the seeds of the flesh are inescapably sown. In Ephesians 4, Paul tells us to "no longer" walk as the Gentiles walk, implying that we used to walk that way. The work of the church is to address these flaws, faults, and characters that are contrary to the nature of God. 

We need the humility and meekness to recognize that we have things to fix. As James 1:21 says, we must receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save our souls. This meekness is not just a general disposition; it is the specific recognition that I have areas of my life that need addressing, fixing, and correcting.

## The Power of Reckoning and Identity

Our mind determines our personality, character, worldview, and outlook. Essentially, our growth is about our mind, and the state of our life is simply the state of our mind. If our life is to fulfill God's purpose, our mind must be aligned with that purpose. 

In Romans 6, Paul points out things the audience already knew rhetorically. He reminds them that they were baptized into Christ's death and that the "old man" was crucified so that we should no longer be slaves to sin. He explains that since Christ died, death no longer has dominion over him because he exhausted all of death's demands. 

Because we died with Christ, we are told to "reckon" ourselves to be dead indeed to sin but alive unto God. This word "reckon" is an accounting term meaning to take account of reality. It is not just knowing; it is affirming and recognizing what is already the case. Our stature speaks to the state of our reckoning, which we will explore further in the upcoming episodes.
