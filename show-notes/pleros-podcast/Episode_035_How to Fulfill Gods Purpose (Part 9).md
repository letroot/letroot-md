# How to Fulfill God's Purpose (Part 9)

Our current focus is on fulfilling God's purpose, which inherently involves spiritual growth. We recognize that growth is essential to realize the divine purpose God has for our lives.

## The Foundation of Discipleship and Spiritual Growth

Recalling previous discussions, God's ultimate purpose for us is sonship. This encompasses both being children of God and heirs of God. As children of God, we are called to walk in fellowship with our Father, embodying His nature and character. As heirs, He has entrusted us with assignments and an inheritance, divided into natural and spiritual categories.

The very essence of our existence, as revealed in scripture, is to fulfill this purpose of sonship. While we can speak of the journey and pursuit of God's purpose, a crucial question remains: how do we actually fulfill it? How is it accomplished?

Luke 12 states that whoever knows the Master's will and does not prepare will be severely punished. It is possible to understand God's will yet fail to act upon it. Furthermore, one might attempt to pursue it without adequate preparation. Such an endeavor is likely to fail if the mind is not renewed or if one has not matured spiritually to execute the purpose as God intends.

Fulfilling God's purpose requires discipleship; it cannot be achieved through the strength of the flesh alone. There is a common misconception that general productivity aligns with God's will. However, the driving force behind that productivity might stem from the flesh or worldly motivations rather than the Holy Spirit.

It is paramount that we prioritize spiritual growth and discipleship. These processes shape and order our lives according to God's heart. Jesus commanded us to preach the gospel, lead people to salvation, and then disciple them to obey all His commands. Paul further elaborated on this discipleship as "perfecting the saints," meaning guiding them towards a specific spiritual destination.

This destination is characterized by two categories: knowledge and stature. Stature describes spiritual growth and maturity. Just as physical stature changes from birth through childhood to adulthood, there is a specific and high spiritual stature God desires for us.

## Holistic Growth and the Renewal of the Mind

Ephesians 4 teaches that by speaking the truth in love, we will all grow into Christ in all things. This powerful scripture indicates that growth must occur in every area of our lives. We might observe individuals strong in love but weak in the supernatural, or robust in the supernatural but lacking in righteousness. God calls for comprehensive growth.

Consider the task of carrying a heavy load, such as two bags of cement. One must first assess if they possess the necessary physical fitness and endurance. Rather than struggling to drag the load, the logical first step is to achieve a level of strength that makes the task feasible. Similarly, God desires us to reach a certain level of spiritual maturity, enabling us to carry out His will effectively.

One fundamental truth we have established is that our mind is the primary zone of growth. While our spiritual nature is transformed at salvation, our mind is where the ongoing work must occur. The extent to which we fulfill God's desires is directly determined by the state of our minds.

Every action and aspect of our lives originates from our minds, yet we frequently underestimate the profound influence of our background and conditioning. We often assume our current mental state is simply "how we are," overlooking the fact that our conditioning prior to personal introspection may have been shaped by worldly influences.

All of us have aspects of the flesh to address within our minds, as we live in a world where the seeds of worldly thinking are pervasively sown. In Ephesians 4, Paul instructs us to "no longer" live as the Gentiles do, implying that this was once our way of life. The church's mission is to address and correct these flaws, faults, and character traits that are contrary to God's nature.

We need humility and meekness to acknowledge areas in our lives that require correction. James 1:21 advises us to "receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls." This meekness is not merely a general disposition; it is the specific recognition that certain areas of our lives need attention, fixing, and alignment with God's word.

## The Power of Reckoning and Identity

Our mind shapes our personality, character, worldview, and overall outlook. Essentially, spiritual growth centers on our mind, and the condition of our life reflects the condition of our mind. If our life is to align with God's purpose, our mind must be similarly aligned.

In Romans 6, Paul uses rhetorical questions to remind his audience of established truths. He recalls their baptism into Christ's death, emphasizing that the "old self" was crucified so we would no longer be enslaved to sin. He explains that because Christ died, death no longer holds dominion over Him, having exhausted all its demands.

Since we died with Christ, we are instructed to "reckon" ourselves dead to sin but alive to God. The word "reckon" is an accounting term, meaning to take stock of a reality. It's not just intellectual understanding; it's an active affirmation and recognition of what is already true in the spiritual realm. Our spiritual stature is fundamentally linked to the state of this reckoning, a concept we will explore further in future episodes.
