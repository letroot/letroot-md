# The Most Important Question

In this video, we're going to be answering the most important question that you need answered: why you need to believe the gospel. If you are someone who has been confronted with the gospel before, you might be wondering why you have to believe it. Some might have presented a case to you, and you might have been satisfied or not, but the urgency remains. Why is there this sense of urgency to believe in the gospel right now?

The answer is that the gospel claims to be the truth of salvation. The moment you start to talk about salvation, you are already talking about danger, a problem, or a situation that is to be avoided. It is something to be averted, something to be delivered from. That's why it's so urgent and important that you hear out what the gospel has to say. More so, when you see it to be the truth, you immediately take that action to accept it.

## Defining the Problem of Sin

If the gospel claims to be the truth of salvation, the real question here is: salvation from what? It is salvation from the common problem that affects all humanity, which we can all see. When something is truth, it means it is such that everybody should be able to see it. You can observe and reason that it is there, much like seeing a book on a table. If there is a problem we are to be saved from, it must be obviously observable.

The Bible calls that problem sin. You may already have ideas about what sin is, but it is not exactly what we are talking about yet. Sin in this case is not just the actions and the conducts that people do. Sin simply means a state that is contrary to what ought to be. To put it another way, sin is a contradiction of what should be.

This contradiction can manifest in different ways. For example, if people are meant to be healthy and they are sick, then that sickness is a state or condition of sin—something contrary to what should be. When we see someone that is dead, death carries an oddity in our minds because we are aware this person had life before. This state of death is contrary to what should be, and God's word uses descriptions of life and death to communicate this.

## The Bondage of Death and Darkness

When we see death, we are aware that life is what is original and was initially present. When that life is gone, we witness a state of darkness and are aware that there was initially light. The claim of the gospel is that we are living in a world where there is the bondage of sin. We are all bound under a condition that is contrary to what should be and, even more, what originally was.

You can never have death if there wasn't initially life, just as there can't be darkness if there wasn't first light. The claim that there is sin implies there was originally a state of life, light, and goodness. Something has messed up that state and brought us to the contradiction of sin, death, and darkness. All of us are bound under that situation, requiring salvation from it without which we are going to fully experience its effects.

When someone dies, the person was already dying; being mortal, we are aging away onto eventual physical death. If one is still under the condition of death and sin in this world, it goes beyond just the physical. It means the person is progressing all the way into eventual damnation and destruction, which is not what is desired by God. This brings us to the message of what the original state of our world was intended to be.

## The Path to Redemption through Christ

When we look at the world and see death, evil, and darkness, it points to the fact that there was initially life, light, and goodness. However, we now face a condition of falsehood, suffering, and pain that is contrary to what is original. If you are in a situation of danger and about to perish, your greatest concern is not how it came to be, but how you are coming out of it.

There is only one way to fix this: where there is death, you need to bring back life, and where there is darkness, you must bring in light. The only way we can be saved from this condition is for the light to enter this world of darkness. This means that which was original must enter into this subsequent state to fix it. In this case, we are talking about God entering a world that has gone off track.

We witness this contradiction in our beliefs, our conduct, and even in nature. We find ourselves doing things we know are not right because of a reign of sin and death. Even a child can suffer the implications of the wrong in nature, witnessing conditions that we know ought not to be. We need salvation from this inherent problem because it is beyond our own conduct to solve.

## Responding to the Truth

God determined to save us by becoming a man, entering into our condition in its fullest expression. He fully bore the consequences of sin, death, and darkness so that He could provide a redemption that is just and legitimate. His resurrection is the proof that He has accomplished all that is necessary to set us free. When you believe in the death and resurrection of Jesus, you are believing in the word of truth.

This truth is not only philosophically necessary, but it is prophetically promised and historically fulfilled in the person of Jesus. If you believe that you need salvation that only God can accomplish, I want you to express that faith with the words of your mouth. Say this with me: "I recognize today that I need salvation. I need redemption from a problem I cannot solve by my own good deeds or conduct."

"I am grateful that God has solved it by becoming a man and bearing the consequence of this bondage for me. I receive that work of redemption that Christ has done. Amen." If you have done that, you are saved, and we have things to help you on your journey. You can follow the directions shown on the screen to get the help you need to continue strongly in God's purpose. Thank you.
