# The Mind of Man (Part 11)

Welcome to Plaro's podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it. 

Welcome to the Blose podcast. This is your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose for your life. We'll be looking at the subject matter, the mind of man, and I believe it's been a very important and impactful teaching. We started our study on the premise of things we had seen earlier, including the reality of God's purpose as sonship. God has called us to be his child and his heir.

## The Necessity of Growth in God’s Purpose

We had seen the roadmap of God's purpose or the pursuit of purpose, the journey of God's purpose. We had the sense of how God's purpose unfolds, but there was a challenge. Knowing exactly the path to take to fulfill purpose does not imply that one has the ability to bear the burden which one is to bear as one works through that path.

Suppose I'm supposed to carry these two loads on both hands and I'm supposed to walk a particular path. I've been shown that I have to go this way and make a turn at this point, but that would not resolve the challenge of the capacity that one has to bear the burden through that journey. That led us to the next point in our study, which is how to fulfill God's purpose where we saw the need for growth. We need growth to be able to fulfill that purpose that God has for us.

## The Biblical Focus on the Mind of Man

At that point, there was yet another challenge where we saw that this growth we're talking about boils down entirely to our mind. That was particularly clear from Ephesians 4 after Paul talked about the work of the church to perfect the saints until we come to the unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son of God. The destination that Paul desires that we come to is a destination in our mind. 

You'll notice that the first two descriptions involve knowledge, and the other two descriptions talking about stature are describing a reality in the mind. This explains why from Ephesians 4:17 downwards to verse 19, Paul kept talking about the mind. He says the reason why the rest of the Gentiles walk the way they do is because of the state of their minds. They are walking in the futility of their mind and their understanding is darkened.

Being alienated from the life of God is the state of their spirit, which Paul addressed in Ephesians 2 as well. He showed that those who have believed in the gospel had a state where they were once dead, but now have been made alive by the work that Christ has done. He showed that their spirit affects why they walk the way they do, but his emphasis notwithstanding was on their mind, the futility of their mind, and the blindness of their heart.

## The Inward and Outward Reality of Humanity

In our study of the mind of man, we had to rightly situate the reality of humanity as a whole. If the mind is the issue, then we must ask what we make of who we are in Christ and the reality of the new creation that we have. We have to account for the dynamics of our nature and the contradiction that could exist in our conduct, which is a result of the gap in the mind. 

To understand that, we looked at two major texts: 1 Thessalonians 5:23 and 2 Corinthians 4:16. The first mentioned that our whole spirit, soul, and body will be preserved blameless until the day of Jesus. 2 Corinthians 4:16 tells us that we have the inward man and the outward man. If you describe any entity with "in" and "out," you have described it entirely using that paradigm. 

He speaks of the dual reality of humanity, whereas 1 Thessalonians has led people to describe man as a tripartite being. If you say man is a spirit, has a soul (meaning a mind), and lives in a body, it works as a very great way of explaining the reality of man. However, the word soul itself does not ordinarily mean mind, and you will surely face challenges with certain texts of scripture if you use it that way.

## Exploring the Different Compartments of the Mind

The account of Lazarus and the rich man serves as an actual account of the inward and outward man. We witness these two individuals alive physically on the earth with their bodies, and then they both died. Their outward man was buried, yet their inward man definitely had a mind with conversations, memories, and reasoning still occurring. They were able to reason and communicate, and we even saw certain mindsets present. 

The rich man still had his mindset prior to his death, such as the pride of trying to send Lazarus on errands. This shows us that there are different realities to the mind, which is a very big word encompassing many things. We see that reasoning is happening on the mind, mindsets are happening on the mind, and memories are happening on the mind. There are about seven things we could point out happening within it. 

In the New Testament Greek, there are two major words for the mind: *nous* and *dianoia*. In Luke 24:45, the Lord opened the understanding of his apostles so that they may comprehend the scriptures. The word "understanding" there is *nous*. This refers to the reasoning part of the mind that was previously closed to the implications of what they had been reading in the scriptures. 

We could say that an aspect of the mind is the reasoning part of man, which you can also verify by your own observation. Whenever you receive information, it gets into your memory to be stored, but another part of your mind reasons about it and may even disagree with it. This brings up the concept of free will and the conviction space in your mind. In the next episode, we're going to be getting to the core of how we work.
