# The Pursuit of God's Purpose (Part 9)

## The Foundation of Sonship and Purpose

Welcome to the Pleros podcast, your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill His purpose. Within each episode, we try to lay one block upon the other to give you a full view of God's intent and how you ought to walk in it. The Bible is written to renew your mind and transform you, and we are currently studying the pursuit of God's purpose itself. 

Based on Ephesians 1:9, we have seen that God's purpose is rooted in sonship. Romans 8:15-17 clarifies that this means He wants children and heirs, desiring us to be in fellowship with Him. As children, we possess His very life and nature, allowing us to relate to Him with a certainty and familiarity that removes any doubt about our value. He reproduces His very seed in us so that we can walk in His nature and character.

## Navigating Our Natural Assignment

Being heirs of God means we have been assigned a specific "lot" or portion of what He owns. This involves both a natural assignment and a spiritual assignment. We have already examined the natural assignment, which involves the natural work and estate God has placed in our hands to manage. This is a natural work that we commit ourselves to carrying out faithfully as part of God's orchestration.

A cardinal text for this is 1 Corinthians 7:17, where Paul instructs us to walk in the condition we were in at the instance of salvation. Whether it involves marital status or your career, God is aware of your circumstances and expects you to commit yourself faithfully to the work in your ends. We appreciate that we start our pursuit of this natural assignment from the very moment we receive salvation.

This natural assignment can be summed up in five key principles. First, you start from where you are, and second, you take advantage of the opportunities that come to you. Third, you pursue your own desire while not misusing the world. Finally, you must be open to the leading of the Spirit and remain maximally productive, understanding that the Lord will judge our faithfulness to this work.

## The Distinction of the Spiritual Assignment

We now proceed to our spiritual assignment, which is something we should fully recognize as a specific lot given to us. There is a real difference between the natural and spiritual assignments in many ways. While the natural assignment allows for more personal disposition, the spiritual assignment has its own rules and its own direction for how it unfolds. 

You could have a belief system that allows you to have a closed mind toward your natural work, but you cannot escape the role of the Spirit. However, it is different when we get to our spiritual assignment. This is not an "as you desire" type of situation. It has its own intentional path that God has for us, which we can see reflected in the sense of inheritance mentioned in the book of Acts.

In Scripture, the idea of an inheritance, a "lot," and a "part" go hand in hand. We see this in Acts 8 and Colossians 1, where God qualifies us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light. Several instances of Scripture tell us that we have a specific part to play in the body of Christ, and more importantly, a specific part in the ministry of that body.

## The Measure of Grace for Every Believer

Ephesians 4:7 notes that to each of us, grace is given according to the measure of the gift of Christ. It is important to realize that the word used is "each," meaning every individual member has received this. This is not a collective gift, but something that belongs to every single person. In this context, grace is something unearned that is given to us for a specific purpose or work.

This grace is not merely for salvation, but is a responsibility that enables us to do something. To understand this grace, we must understand the gift of Christ, which verse 11 identifies as the leadership responsibilities of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. These gifts are given for the perfection of the saints and the work of ministry.

As Paul continues in Ephesians 4:16, it becomes clear that every member of the body has a part. The only way the body grows or increases is because each part does its own share. We all have a share to do in this work of ministry, and we are going to pick it up from here in the next episode to see how to pursue that specific spiritual assignment.
