# The Reality of God's Purpose (Part 6)

Welcome to Plerose podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truth of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

All right, brothers and sisters. This is still the Plerose podcast, a daily dose of God's word, transforming you to fulfill God's purpose, right? And we are still unearthing God's purpose for our life. I trust you've been following. We have seen thus far that God's purpose is sonship. We saw that in Ephesians 1:9, God has made known to us what he likes and what he wants. 

Ephesians 1:5 told us what he likes and what he wants is sonship. Romans 8 explains to us what sonship is. Romans 8 says sonship is to be God's child and to be God's heir because the reality of the spirit of sonship, when put to the test and examined, reveals these two things. So these two realities are seen when we put the spirit of sonship to the test. 

What's the first thing we see? We see that we are children of God. That word in the Greek is *technon* from *titco*, which means we are birthed or reproduced by God. Then the second thing we see about ourselves when we look at the spirit of sonship is that when you are a child of God, then you are an heir of God. 

## The Reality of Sonship and Being Heirs

Now we're looking at something important in the last episode. What we're looking at is when we say we are heirs of God, what can God even give to us? Don't forget the word heir means you are one who has been assigned something by another. So if you say I'm an heir, anyone should ask you "of who?" because you are saying I'm one that has been assigned something by someone. 

There are those two questions that will naturally be asked if you say I'm an heir: "of who?" and "of what?" It's very legitimate to ask that question in this case when we say we are heirs of God and when we say we are joint heirs with Christ. I like that the question indeed is resolved by Paul. After he talks about us being of God, the very next set of verses in Romans chapter 8 starts to talk about how the creation is a beneficiary of the reality of who we are. 

It's only if you miss the fact that he called us heirs that you fail to see the connection between who we are as sons and the implication it has upon creation as a whole. What he's doing there is to say the effect of our being heirs is that we are now granted ownership of creation. The management right over creation is such that whatever direction we take is going to affect creation. Whatever we are of by nature is going to affect what our inheritance is. 

## Authority and Ownership over Creation

We are going to effect the reality of our power, our authority, and our life upon creation at the right time. That's what leads to Romans 8:19 where he said for the earnest expectation, the desire—and it's sort of using a personification for what we may consider inanimate. Of course, there are animate entities in creation, but as a whole, speaking about creation, you might want to talk about it in an inanimate way. 

Yet, he uses a personal attribute for creation. It says the earnest expectation, the desire of creation, is waiting eagerly for the manifestation or unveiling of the sons of God. So he's waiting for that point where the sons of God effect who they are on their mortal bodies and in that same breath upon all creation. And that's to show you that the sons of God, what they have as heirs of God, is authority and right over creation. 

Remember what we're talking about last time. Right now, in existence, we can classify things into two. We have the self-existent God—I am that I am—and we have the created existence, which is the natural world what God has made. If God is going to allot anything to anyone, he's not allotting himself per se. There's a sense in which we say, well, God gave us his spirit and that's something he has allotted to us, his nature, but not still his person. 

## The Spirit of Sonship and Shared Responsibility

You can't own God as a person. You can have his nature and the implications of his nature on all creation, and you can in that sense even say the spirit of God is what God allotted to me as an inheritor. In fact, there's text for that in God's word. But that is not our focus in this sense. Why I'm also concerned is that when people go to texts that speak about the spirit as our inheritance, they are failing to see that the very spirit God gave us is the spirit of sonship. 

Which still means after saying God gave you the spirit, you still have to explain what the implication of giving the spirit means for what your assignment is. Because the fact that you have the spirit given to you by God is with the sense that something belongs to you. I don't know if you are getting that. I hope I'm not like confusing you there. Let me take it again. You can rightly say in one sense God has allotted his spirit to me. 

But what spirit did he give you? The spirit of sonship. Which means within what he gave you is still a responsibility. Within what he gave you is still something he gave you, right? Because if the spirit is the spirit of sonship and sonship is essentially about being an heir of God, then as an heir of God there is still something he is allotting to you in the fact that he has allotted the spirit to you. 

## Joint Inheritance with Christ

So you cannot separate this reality of inheritance beyond just having God's nature. There is something you have as God's own. We were looking at this the last time: that we could say we have all of creation. It says we are heirs of God, joint heirs with Christ. I remember then in law school we were taught severed inheritance and joint inheritance. In someone allotting his property, he could give what he owns in common to a group of people. 

When it says we are joint heirs with Christ, it's talking about a joint inheritance, which means there is something we co-inherit with Christ. He's saying all believers are co-inheriting with Christ. You recall Hebrews 1:1-3, the reality of Christ being heir of all things. Even if those are words spoken to the fulfillment of Christ, the words themselves are about the lordship of Christ over all of creation. 

In being co-heirs with Christ, we cannot separate that reality that we own all of creation. Within what God owns, he is assigning his creation to us. Let me point out one of the texts I mentioned earlier, which is Matthew 5:5. It says blessed are the meek, pointing out the reality of our faith as meek. We realize that we need help and we are receiving that redemption in Christ. 

The beatitudes are all pointing to the reality of faith in Christ. Those who are hungry, that means they are not satisfied; they know that there's a need that they have. You notice almost all the beatitudes are all themed around the need for something. The poor in spirit need something; the meek, of course, is someone that is needing help; the hungry are seeking something more. 

## Faithfulness in Our Natural Assignments

Matthew 5:5 says blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. So he's saying all of us that are of faith own the earth, joint heirs with Christ of God. What does God own? Creation. What do we own with him? Creation. What does Christ own? Creation. He has redeemed creation back away from the hands and the hold of death and darkness and has gotten the rights to creation based on the legitimate victory that he has gotten over sin, death, and darkness. 

So now owned by Christ, and because we are joint heirs with Christ, we own creation now. We are going to effect upon creation God's nature and desired goal of life and light. But is that all there is to our inheritance? Does it mean anything for our purpose right here and right now? What are you supposed to do? Why did the creator make you and put you here? Where is your place in all of this cosmic drama? 

In our joint inheritance of creation, there's still the reality of severed inheritance where that joint inheritance is divided or severed to different persons. So you have this and I have that, and on and on we go. Look again at Colossians chapter 3. You have an individual inheritance in one regard which is a natural one. There is a natural inheritance and there's a spiritual inheritance that you have. 

Colossians 3:22 to chapter 4:1 says: bondservants, obey in all things your masters. In today's parlance we would say employees. Obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not with eye service as men pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing God. So your obedience to your masters is because of God. Why? Because you are fearing God. Whatever you do, do it heartily as to the Lord and not to men. 

Your faithfulness to your boss is recognizing that your boss was put there by the Lord. The same way you feel God gave a spiritual person to you for your growth, God gave this person to lead you as you're carrying out this assignment within the earth. Knowing that it is from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance, for you serve the Lord Christ. Your natural work is service to the Lord. 

How faithful are you with your natural assignment? He has given you work to do. Don't be found handling it carelessly, lightly, or loosely. Take it with all seriousness. There's a natural assignment the Lord has given you. Catch you on the next one, brothers and sisters. Bless you.
