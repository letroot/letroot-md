# How to Fulfill God's Purpose (Part 1)

If you have been following our series, you will have seen how we are transitioning to a new but related topic. We began by examining the place of the gospel in our lives, establishing that the gospel is truth.

From there, we explored the reality of God's purpose. We didn't just understand the truth about the world, its current state, and how we are saved from its contradictions, but we also addressed the crucial question of purpose: Why are we here? What is the reason for our existence, and what is the reason for our lives? From Ephesians 1:5 and 9, we understand that God's primary purpose for humanity is sonship.

Sonship signifies being both a child and an heir of God. As children of God, we share His nature, life, and character, which calls us into deep fellowship with Him. This fellowship, in turn, strengthens us to embody His nature and character. The other aspect of God's purpose is our role as heirs. As heirs, we receive specific assignments, broadly categorized as natural and spiritual.

## Pursuing Natural and Spiritual Assignments

The next step was to understand how we carry out these assignments within God's overarching purpose. For our natural assignment, we identified five critical elements: starting where we are, leveraging opportunities, utilizing the world responsibly, remaining open to the Spirit's leading in all endeavors, and maintaining maximum productivity.

For our spiritual assignment, we also identified five key steps. I need to correct a mistake from the last episode: I previously stated "growing until discipleship," but I meant "growing into leadership." The correct steps are: committing to discipleship in the local church, going out to reach people, preaching and publicizing the gospel, discipling those who receive the message, and finally, growing into leadership.

Every believer is intended to grow into leadership as part of God's purpose. First Timothy states, "If any man desires the office of a bishop, he desires a good work." The term "bishop" simply means a leader or an overseer. While contemporary understanding often places a bishop higher than a pastor, in the scriptures, roles like bishop, pastor, and elder refer to the same general responsibility of oversight and leadership.

## The Cycle of Participation in the Church

The scriptures reason that all of us, as we fulfill our spiritual assignments, are meant to grow into leadership. We observe this in the New Testament, where individuals like Philemon and others mentioned in Romans 16 led churches in their homes. These individuals took responsibility; they were not mere consumers but active participants in the mission of the Lord Jesus.

A church was not designed for passive consumption, like a customer buying a product. If you purchase an item like Coca-Cola, you consume it for your own benefit, and the product demands nothing further from you. However, the gospel operates differently. While you receive the gospel as a consumer for salvation and spiritual growth, this transformation is intended to lead to your active participation and commitment to its spread.

This vision is clearly articulated in Ephesians 4, which states that "each of us has grace according to the measure of Christ's gift." He appointed leaders—apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers—"for the perfecting of the saints." By verse 16, these perfected saints are expected to function in that same responsibility of leadership towards others. A continuous cycle of leadership development is meant to occur within the church.

## Preparation as Key to Fulfillment

Now, let us examine how to fulfill God's purpose. One might ask about the distinction between "pursuing" and "fulfilling" purpose. The pursuit describes the journey itself, outlining how the purpose unfolds from beginning to end. Individuals like Gaius, Erastus, or Onesimus, despite their varied starting points, all faithfully served the church. However, the journey itself requires that one is capable of carrying it out effectively.

Consider the example of someone whose purpose is to carry two heavy bags of cement for 500 meters. To succeed, preparation is essential. One must train at the gym, determining the strength required to reach the destination without dropping the bags. This preparation is what enables the fulfillment of the purpose. Knowing the journey without adequate preparation makes for a very difficult path.

This introduces the concept of how to fulfill God's purpose, drawing insights from Luke 12:47, which speaks of those who know the will but fail to prepare. In our next discussion, we will delve into the specific factors that empower us to fulfill God's purpose.
