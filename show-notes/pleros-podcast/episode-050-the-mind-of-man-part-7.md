# The Mind of Man (Part 7)

This series focuses on the mind of man. We have explored the roadmap of God's purpose and how personal growth facilitates its fulfillment. This study consistently points to the mind as the primary determinant of whether we achieve God's purpose for our lives.

Our life is a direct product of our mind. This highlights the critical importance of our mind in our walk with God and in fulfilling His purpose. It is essential to understand the intricacies of the human mind—what processes occur there, what influences it, and how these factors shape the outcomes we experience. Recognizing the mind's role also sheds light on the significance of our spirit.

God's ultimate purpose for us is sonship: to be His children and heirs, walking in fellowship with Him, embodying His nature and character, and pursuing the assignments He has given us. Fulfilling this purpose requires significant growth in our minds. The mind's power and importance cannot be overstated, yet this understanding naturally leads to questions about the specific changes that occur at salvation.

To grasp the holistic nature of humanity, we turn to 1 Thessalonians 5:23, which states, "May the God of peace sanctify you completely... may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless until the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ." While "soul" is often equated with "mind," caution is warranted before making that direct correlation. Nonetheless, this verse establishes that man is comprised of a spirit, possesses a soul (which includes the mind), and inhabits a body.

## The Inward and Outward Man: A Biblical Distinction

Paul offers a slightly different perspective in 2 Corinthians chapter 4, simplifying the description of man into an "inward man" and an "outward man." Verse 16 states, "Therefore we do not lose heart, even though our outward man is perishing, yet our inward man is being renewed day by day." This distinction—inward and outward—encompasses the entire reality of a person.

We can view the inward and outward man as parallel aspects of human existence, both integral to the essential framework of humanity. Conceptually, man has a body with a brain, and a spirit with a mind. This aligns with the biblical understanding, and a specific account from the Gospels vividly illustrates this truth.

## The Enduring Consciousness of the Inward Man

In Luke chapter 16, we find the narrative of Lazarus and the rich man. This appears to be an actual event rather than a parable or a fictitious story. The account describes a rich man, sumptuously clothed, and a beggar named Lazarus, covered in sores. Both individuals possessed an inward man and an outward man.

When the beggar died, it was his outward man—his physical body—that perished. His inward man, however, was carried by angels to Abraham’s bosom. Similarly, when the rich man died and was buried, his body remained in the grave, but another part of him was in torment in Hades. He was fully conscious, able to lift his eyes and perceive Abraham and Lazarus, clearly demonstrating the continued existence and awareness of his inward man.

Hades is a temporary holding place for the dead before the final judgment, similar to someone held in custody before sentencing. It is distinct from the Lake of Fire, which represents the second death. In this intermediate state, we observe the inward man's continued interaction and awareness even after the physical body has departed.

## The Inward Man's Mind: Memory, Reason, and Affection

In Luke 16:24, the rich man cries out to Abraham for mercy. His recognition of Lazarus and Abraham clearly indicates that his mind remains active. When instructed to "remember" his lifetime, it affirms that his memory persists even without a physical body. Furthermore, his expressed concern for his five brothers demonstrates the enduring presence of his reasoning capacity and family affections.

Acts 2:27 corroborates this reality concerning the death and resurrection of Jesus: "For you will not leave my soul in Hades, nor will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption." Here, "corruption" refers to the physical body, while "soul" denotes the inward man in its entirety. This verse underscores that the inward man is an enduring reality, continuing to exist even without the outward man.

The scriptural accounts unequivocally demonstrate that the inward man possesses a mind capable of memory, recollection of details, and reasoning. Therefore, it is accurate to conceptualize the outward man as a body with a brain, and the inward man as a spirit with a distinct mind. This consistent biblical description confirms that the inward man is not devoid of mental faculties.

For the believer, the inward man is united with Christ. By divine nature, our spirit is inherently like God and like Christ. However, this spirit is accompanied by a mind that may not yet be fully renewed or enlightened concerning the realities of its new nature. This situation can be likened to a human individual who, due to their upbringing, mistakenly believes they are a dog; they operate under this false identity simply because they are unaware of their true human capacity to stand upright.

We will delve deeper into these concepts in our next discussion. Our exploration today has aimed to firmly establish the understanding that you are a spirit with a mind, residing in a body with a brain. This fundamental truth holds profound implications for our spiritual growth and our journey in fulfilling God's purpose.
