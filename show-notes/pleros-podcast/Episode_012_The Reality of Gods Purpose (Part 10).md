# The Reality of God's Purpose (Part 10)

Welcome to Pleros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Welcome to another episode of Pleros podcast, your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. Our study has been on that very subject matter: the reality of God's purpose. We are trying to make it clear why exactly you're on earth. There's nothing more important for the believer to settle than the truth of his existence.

## The Question of Purpose and Sonship

The root answer to the question of existence is because there is God. There's a self-existent being who has made the world, but we must ask: why did He make me? Before then, we always have to answer how come the world is this way. How come there's a contradiction in the world for which we now need a redemption, which is what the gospel's message then centers on?

If you have believed the message of the gospel, then you have believed the reality of God and the reality of redemption. Clearly, your greatest burden should be: what is God's purpose? Why am I here, and what does He want me to do? He has a reason He made me, and whatever has gone wrong, He has redeemed me via the work Christ has done.

The answer to that is something He reveals to us: sonship. As seen in Ephesians 1:5 and 1:9, sonship means to be God's child and God's heir. Romans 8:15-17 explains that being an heir of God means there is a lot that is assigned to you. The related Greek words are *kleronomos* (heir), *kleronomia* (inheritance), and *kleronomeo* (to inherit).

## Understanding Inheritance as Assignment

These words play out towards two main parts. There is *kleros*, which is a lot or the portion in question, such as a land, a business, or a house. The second part is *nomos*, from which we get the word for law. It refers to something ordered, instructed, laid down, or assigned. Therefore, the best word to communicate being an heir is the word "assign."

It's like if someone says you are to do this or that; the person is ordering and assigning responsibilities. God assigns lots to people, and in this sense, we can say we have assignments. In God's purpose, we are not just children of ease by nature. We are also heirs—those who have been assigned things to do. This is baked into the understanding of God's purpose.

When we speak about what God's purpose is, preachers often give different ideas with good intentions. However, some of those ideas are likely to hit a wall of dissatisfaction as people think further. Sometimes you ask people what God's purpose is and they say "to know Jesus and to make Jesus known." As noble as it sounds, that is really not what God's purpose is at its core.

To say God made us from scratch just for that is not being honest with the entire account. I believe people who say this mean zero harm, but it hits a roadblock when we appreciate that God's purpose preceded the redemptive role. This is what was on God's mind: sonship. This means we are God's children and heirs, called to fellowship with Him and walk in His nature.

## The Priority of Spiritual Assignments

As His heirs, we have assignments given to us. A natural assignment includes all the labors we have in the natural world which are noble and good for this time. However, the world is still going to come to an end before it is redeemed. While the service of people born out of faith will be rewarded, the blessing to those who haven't received the gospel pales in comparison to their need for redemption.

By virtue of value, the priority is on our spiritual assignment. If you break an egg versus the screen of an iPhone, both are valuable, but one is more so. Similarly, we must establish that there is such a thing as a spiritual inheritance. We see this in Acts 1:17 and 25 regarding Judas, where it was said someone was to take "his part" in the ministry given to the twelve.

Ministry is explained as an inheritance that God allots to people. It is a share of what He is trying to do in the world. In Acts 8, we notice that the word "lot" is parallel with the word "part" (*meros*). These have the same implication: a portion of a whole that is given to someone. This word *meros* is used specifically to speak of the body of Christ and the believer's role in ministry.

## Our Part in the Body of Christ

In 1 Corinthians 12:27, Paul says, "Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually." The word "individually" here means members of a part. You are not the whole body; you make up a part as a member. 1 Corinthians 12:5 adds that there are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. This understanding of ministries is parallel to being individual members of the body.

Romans 12:4 also says that as we have many members in one body, all the members do not have the same function. We being many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. Each of us is a member, and ministry is at play in the fact that we are a part of the body. Probably the clearest text on this is Ephesians chapter 4.

Ephesians 4:16 explains that from Christ, the whole body is joined and knit together by the supply of every ligament. Every part (*meros*) does its share, causing the growth of the body. We become connected with the body of Christ because every part is doing its own share of ministry. As verse 12 says, we are to be perfected as saints for the work of ministry for the edifying of the body.

You are perfected as a saint to do your part, which is ministry, causing others to be joined to the body. You supply the ligament—God's word and spirit—for their growth and salvation. You are a part and you have a ministry. We each have a spiritual assignment just as we have a natural assignment. You have a spiritual assignment, and you need to get into it. Catch you on the next one.
