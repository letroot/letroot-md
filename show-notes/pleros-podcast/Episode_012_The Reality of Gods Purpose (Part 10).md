# The Reality of God's Purpose (Part 10)

Our ongoing study explores the reality of God's purpose. Our aim is to clarify why each of us is on earth. For the believer, few truths are more crucial to firmly grasp than the purpose of their existence.

The fundamental answer to the question of existence is the existence of God—a self-existent being who created the world. However, we must then ask: why did He create me? This leads to a further question: why does the world contain contradiction and a need for redemption, which forms the core message of the gospel?

If you have embraced the gospel, you have accepted the reality of God and the reality of redemption. Consequently, your primary concern should be understanding God's purpose. Why are you here, and what does He intend for you to do? He created you for a specific reason, and through Christ's work, He has redeemed you from whatever went wrong.

God reveals His answer to this purpose: sonship. As outlined in Ephesians 1:5 and 1:9, sonship signifies being God's child and God's heir. Romans 8:15-17 elaborates that being an heir of God implies a significant assignment. The related Greek terms are *kleronomos* (heir), *kleronomia* (inheritance), and *kleronomeo* (to inherit).

## Understanding Inheritance as Assignment

These terms encompass two main components. First, *kleros*, which denotes a lot or portion, such as land, a business, or a house. Second, *nomos*, from which we derive the word "law." It refers to something ordered, instructed, laid down, or assigned. Therefore, "assignment" is the most fitting word to convey the meaning of being an heir.

Just as a command assigns responsibilities, God assigns "lots" to people. In this sense, we have assignments. God's purpose for us means we are not merely children of ease; we are heirs—those entrusted with specific tasks. This concept is fundamental to understanding God's purpose.

When discussing God's purpose, preachers often present various ideas with good intentions. However, some of these ideas may lead to dissatisfaction upon deeper reflection. For instance, when asked about God's purpose, some might say "to know Jesus and to make Jesus known." While noble, this does not fully capture God's core purpose.

To suggest God created us solely for this redemptive role disregards the broader narrative. While those who express this mean no harm, it overlooks the fact that God's purpose predates the need for redemption. At its core, God's purpose is sonship: we are His children and heirs, called to fellowship with Him and embody His nature.

## The Priority of Spiritual Assignments

As His heirs, we are given assignments. These include natural assignments—all the honorable and beneficial labors we undertake in the physical world during our lifetime. However, the world, in its current state, is destined to end before its ultimate redemption. While faithful service in natural endeavors will be rewarded, its value pales in comparison to the eternal need for redemption for those who have not received the gospel.

Therefore, by virtue of eternal value, our spiritual assignment holds priority. Consider the difference in value between breaking an egg and breaking an iPhone screen; both are valuable, but one significantly more so. Similarly, we must recognize the existence of a spiritual inheritance. This is evident in Acts 1:17 and 25, where, concerning Judas, it was stated that someone must take "his part" in the ministry given to the twelve.

Ministry is thus presented as an inheritance God allots to people—a share in what He is working to accomplish in the world. In Acts 8, the word "lot" is paralleled with "part" (*meros*), both implying a portion of a whole given to an individual. This word *meros* is specifically used to describe the body of Christ and the believer's role in ministry.

In 1 Corinthians 12:27, Paul declares, "Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually." Here, "individually" means members of a specific part. You are not the entire body, but you contribute a part as a member. 1 Corinthians 12:5 adds that there are diverse ministries, but the same Lord. This concept of ministries aligns with being individual members of the body.

## Our Indispensable Role in the Body of Christ

Romans 12:4 further states that just as we have many members in one body, not all members have the same function. Though many, we are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another. Each of us is a member, and ministry is inherently tied to our being a part of this body. Perhaps the clearest exposition of this is found in Ephesians chapter 4.

Ephesians 4:16 explains that from Christ, "the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love." Our connection with the body of Christ thrives because every part contributes its share of ministry. As verse 12 specifies, saints are to be perfected "for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ."

You are perfected as a saint to fulfill your unique part, which is ministry, thereby helping others become joined to the body. You supply the "ligament"—God's word and Spirit—for their growth and salvation. You are an integral part, and you have a ministry. Each of us has a spiritual assignment, just as we have natural assignments. It is crucial to embrace and engage with your spiritual assignment.
