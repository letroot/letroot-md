# The Reality of God's Purpose (Part 12)

Welcome to Plar Rose podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

## The Foundation of Revelation

All right, another episode of the Pleos podcast. This is your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. We've established that God's purpose can only be known by revelation. He himself has to reveal this to us, and therefore the only source we can trust for the revelation of his purpose is the objective and direct source of his revelation.

So God can talk to people and we know that. But this personal revelation is always fraught with subjectivity in a way that the direct, primary, authorized, validated revelation of himself—which is the written word—is not fraught with. So we can rest and trust the written word as God's objective and direct revelation in a way that personal revelation cannot be trusted, even though it doesn't make them non-valuable. 

In fact, they are very valuable. If you arrest your faith in God's word and you make it the foundation of your persuasion, you should be wise enough to handle personal revelation and put them in their rightful place as you walk in God's will for your life. So, I'm by no means speaking against personal revelation or God speaking today, but I'm showing us what the word of God and God himself expects of us in how we view and understand him and his will for our life.

## Understanding Sonship and Inheritance

So what does God's word say God's purpose is? He calls it sonship, right? Ephesians 1:9, Ephesians 1:5. What does sonship mean? It means to be God's child and God's heir. Romans 8:15-17. Being God's child, we are called to fellowship with him and to walk in his nature and character, which is a reality that we are meant to maintain.

You maintain fellowship with God. You maintain a walk in his nature and character. Those things on their own do not give us any goal to go after. They don't give us any clear sense of pursuit. They don't give us any sense of accomplishment or fulfillment, which are things we are yet designed with. 

But when we speak about being heirs of God, then we enter into the arena of accomplishment, goals, and purpose in the sense of something set before you to do. There's purpose in the sense of what God set before him that he wants, which is sonship. But now when we talk about being heirs of God, there is what you are to do. There's what you are to fulfill. There's what you are to accomplish. 

## Natural and Spiritual Assignments

It is in that light that we have been making quite some emphasis on being heirs of God. You recall that as an heir of God we have said there are two assignments you have. Understanding the word heirs, *kleronomos*, means someone who has been assigned a lot—a *kleros*. There are two things God has assigned you to do: He has assigned to you a natural assignment and a spiritual assignment. 

It's very clear in his word. Anyone who speaks down on what you do in the natural is going to be your loss if you buy it because God's word is quite clear that he has given you things to do in the natural. This is not like trying to whine in motivationally, which people can do, but I'm talking from a standpoint of philosophy and theology. If you are studying God's word to find out what his purpose is, what you have in your hands to do naturally is his allotment to you that he expects to unfold into all that he wants to see fulfilled through you.

I can understand the concern that the lines can be blurred with personal ambition and desires, competition, and so on and so forth. That's a challenge that is at play. Interestingly, even for spiritual assignment that happens as well because there's a tendency to look over your shoulders to other people or looking to decide what someone else is doing. You can see a spirit of competition people can have when it comes to natural assignment as well. 

These are just tendencies because we are in a broken world where the influence of sin and flesh is at play. But this should not make us deny the things that are readily true in God's word. You have a natural assignment which you should take very seriously. Even in fact, your natural assignment is going to take a bulk of your time over and above your spiritual assignment for most people. 

Now there will be those who by design of their responsibilities would spend really a whole lot more time in their spiritual assignment than their natural one, even though they still should do their natural assignment as Paul encouraged, setting ourselves as examples for others. So there is this understanding we need to have. We shouldn't think of what we do in the natural in a way as not of God. 

## The Allotment of Ministry

But then there's our spiritual assignment, which I've said we must hold as priority as a matter of its value. Even if we are unable to give it that time that we have to give to our natural assignment, yet because of the priority we place on it, we will give it the dedication that it requires. Maybe on a daily basis you have to allot two hours or thereabouts for your spiritual assignments because you value it as that important. 

You will be dedicated to it, yet you're going to spend like some seven, eight, or nine hours on your natural assignment and you shouldn't do that feeling, "Oh man, I'm doing something bad." No, you are doing all of God's will. You are being awesome. You just have to learn to be dedicated. We'll get to all of that later. They are some of the things we'll build on when we get there. 

I just want to tie the knot on our spiritual assignment. When we do that, we have kind of covered the entire scope of what God's purpose is. I just want to ensure that I leave no stone unturned in ensuring that you are fully persuaded about your spiritual assignment. Now for spiritual assignment, I said the same word "lot"—which is a portion usually assigned to someone—is used for ministry in Acts 1:17 and 1:25. 

That word "lots" is used parallel to the word *meros* in Acts 8:21, for example. Interestingly, the other text where you see "lot" and *meros* used alongside one another is Colossians 1:12. I was emphasizing that to show you the consistent use of "part" relative to our place as believers in ministry in the body of Christ. Like in 1 Corinthians 12:27, the surrounding context of that particular text is very strongly ministry related. 

## The Body of Christ and Reconciliation

Maybe more clearly, Ephesians 4:16 says each part is doing a share to bring about the growth of the body. The share that each part is doing—their own individual share—no doubt is about ministry because Ephesians 4:12 is what unfolds from 13 to 16. The perfecting of saints leads to work of ministry, which leads to the fin of the body of Christ. This whole body of Christ is joined to Christ because people are supplying that which joins the ligament. 

This supply is by the effectual working when each part is doing a share. Each of us is a part; we have our share to do, supply the ligament, and as more people are joined, we make up the entire body of Christ which causes the growth of the body in the fin of servant. You are a part with a share. In fact, I would like you to say, "I'm a part of the body of Christ with a share that has been allotted to me." 

You know that word share is the word *metron*. It's quite interesting because the idea of *metron* has to do with measurement when it comes to a land. So it is exactly what has been measured out for you to do. There's what the lord wants you to do. Now I was showing as well from Ephesians 4:7 that to each of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ. 

Each of us have grace given unto us according to the measure of Christ. You have grace. That's why he spoke about the effectual working by which each part does a share, because that term effectual working is often used for the grace of God which is like an extra working despite your own work. You have grace given unto you according to the measure of the gift of Christ. 

The gift he gave, as seen in verse 11, is what he calls the apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers, which are essentially leadership ministry terms. So whilst there's the general reality of ministry, he uses in this context leadership ministry terms and he says you have grace for leadership in ministry. So it gets even serious, but I don't think we can delve into that fully at this point in our study. You are not excluded from ministry, and even more, leadership in ministry.

Now I want us to wrap up with 2 Corinthians 5 from verse 17 downwards. All of us have a part in ministry. He says if any man be in Christ, he's a new creation; all things have passed away, and all things have become new. All things which have become new are of God who has reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation. So you cannot miss that. 

The man who is a new creation, who has all things new, who has been reconciled to God, is the very same one who is said to be given the ministry of reconciliation. You have the ministry of reconciliation. You cannot escape that. And that ministry, we are told in verse 19, is about the word of reconciliation. Let's just wrap up saying this: "I have the ministry of reconciliation which is to minister the word of reconciliation. I have a spiritual assignment and it is priority as a matter of value. I place priority on my spiritual assignment." 

All right, we'll catch you on the next one where we'll be looking at what do I do about the assignments given to me by God.
