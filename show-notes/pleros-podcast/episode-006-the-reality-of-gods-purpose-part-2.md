# The Reality of God's Purpose (Part 2)

Welcome to Plaro's podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Brothers and sisters, we are still looking at the subject matter of God's purpose. We have started out by seeing the gospel's place as truth in our life—not just the claim of it being truth, but the proof that it is truth. On those grounds, we accept his testimony of the revelation of God's will. In the last episode, we began to see what is called God's will or God's purpose, and our central text in this regard was Ephesians 1:9.

We have seen the gospel proving the reality of God, the reality of redemption fulfilled in Christ, and the reality of who we are in Christ. Right now, we have two more things to see as the truth that the gospel proves. In this particular instance, we are going to zoom in quite some bit because it's a subject matter that is very foundational to our work as believers. I do want you to pay close attention to it.

## The Purpose and Good Pleasure of God

In Ephesians 1:9, Paul says, "Having made known to us the mystery of his will." The subject matter in this text is God; he has made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself. What we call God's purpose is what he proposed in himself. If you get to Ephesians 1:11, you see Paul speak about this purpose again, stating that we have obtained an inheritance being predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will.

This purpose is said to be his good pleasure and his will. That which he purposed in himself is his good pleasure—what he likes—and his will—what he wants. If we ask what God's purpose is, even without knowing the exact answer, you can say it is what he likes and what he wants. This shifts the question to: what exactly is it that he likes and wants?

Ephesians 1:5 answers that part of the question. It says, "Having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will." Because of the good pleasure of his will, he predestined us to adoption as sons. Therefore, what he predestined us to has to be the good pleasure of his will.

## Understanding the Meaning of Huiothesia

The act of predestining us was because of the good pleasure of his will. This implies that when we take a look at that predestination and see the result of it—where it was headed or what it eventually turned out to be—we can tell what the good pleasure of his will is. He predestined us to "adoption as sons" or "adoption of children."

The interesting thing here is that these words happened to be just one word in the Greek. When Paul wrote in his original language, the word he used was *huiothesia*. Of course, that is a compound word with two parts at play, but it is exactly one word. If he brought us by that work of redemption in Christ Jesus to this thing called *huiothesia*, what exactly does it mean?

There are two ways to look at the spelling when rendered in English form: *huiothesia* comes from *huios*, which literally means "son," and *tithemi*, which means "to put" or "to place." If I put my phone on a table, I "tithemi" my phone on the table. So, when you combine *huios* and *tithemi* into a noun, you are simply saying "the placement as a son." It is the state of being placed as a son, which we call "sonship."

## Israel as the Model of Sonship

God has brought us to sonship by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will. If we ask what God likes and what God wants, the answer is sonship. Sonship is what he has proposed. However, at this point, it may seem vague. Does he mean he wants male children? The answer is no, because that's not what the depth of sonship means.

Before I explain further, I want you to see something in Romans chapter 9. We are told that God reflected this reality of sonship in Israel. Israel were called by him as his chosen people to fulfill redemption because, through them, the Christ was going to come. God reflected his will and purpose through them, and what Paul says in Romans 9:4 is profound.

Paul says of the Israelites, "to whom pertain the adoption." That is the exact same word, *huiothesia*. We could say to them pertained "sonship." The very first thing Paul wants us to understand about the Israelites was that sonship is what they were about. It was what God was reflecting and showing forth in and through them.

## Service and the Spirit of Adoption

We find the concept of sonship very early on when Yahweh spoke to Moses to deliver the Israelites. In Exodus 4:22, he told Moses to say to Pharaoh, "Israel is my son, my firstborn." He makes it clear that what Israel is meant to be, in essence, is his son. He says, "Let my son go that he may serve me."

There is still service in sonship. Within the reality of sonship is service, as understood in both the Hebrew and Greek minds. So what does sonship mean for your life? Some might ask how this "puts food on the table" or what they are supposed to do with it. That question is very valid, and the best text to resolve it is Romans chapter 8.

In Romans 8:15, Paul says, "You did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear... but you received the spirit of adoption [sonship], whereby we cry, Abba, Father." This spirit of sonship has to do with being God's child, as it involves a very familiar way of relating with him. It is the cry of a real child towards his dad. The spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, but there is even more to it that we will explore in the next episode.
