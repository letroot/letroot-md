# Faith Stand (Part 4)

We have been studying the faith stand, exploring God's purpose for our lives, the roadmap for walking in that purpose, and the vital need for growth. Growth happens in the mind, impacting our work and our conduct. We need to think through issues and meditate on them to ensure our convictions are right. We walk or "do" the word as a result of faith.

## The Implanted Word: Seed vs. Process

In James 1:21, we are told to receive the implanted word. The word of God is like a seed that needs to grow, highlighting a distinction between salvation and spiritual growth. In salvation, you receive the seed of God's word and you are saved instantly. However, when it comes to your walk, hearing a truth is just the beginning of a growth process.

Whether it is a truth about healing, being loved in Christ, or being dead to sin, it is planted on your heart as a seed. Your experience of that truth requires growth, unlike the instant nature of the new birth. While the spirit is received at the instance of salvation, the implanted word acts as a seed that grows to change your life and save your soul.

When we talk about the soul here, we are often referring to the mind. It is the mind that the word of God affects to change your life. In James 1:22, we are exhorted to be doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving ourselves. This deception means "reckoning aside yourself," where you hear God's word and agree with it but maintain a different reckoning in practice.

## Abiding in the Mirror of Truth

James describes a man observing his natural face in a mirror. When we look into the mirror of the word, we aren't just looking for what is wrong; we are seeing who we are in Christ. We see that we are new creations, begotten by the word of truth and made like God by nature. The problem arises when a person observes this reality and then immediately goes away and forgets.

The reason he forgets is simply that he "goes away" from that reality. In contrast, the person who looks into the perfect law of liberty and "continues" in it is blessed. The Greek word here is *parameno*, which means to abide or dwell beside. This person sees their identity as a loved being in Christ and chooses to stay there, affirming that reality without moving.

Because of this faith stand, the person is not a "forgetful hearer." Forgetfulness here isn't about losing a memory of the sermon; it is a lack of consciousness regarding who they are. If you continue and keep that consciousness, your reactions to life's pressures will be born out of the righteousness, love, and peace you have built within yourself.

## The Practice of Reckoning and Presentation

Paul reinforces this in Romans 6, where he affirms that his audience already knows who they are in Christ. However, knowledge is not enough; he instructs them in verse 11 to "reckon yourself" to be dead to sin and alive to God. This reckoning is described using the word "present." We are told to present ourselves as instruments of righteousness.

The word for present is *paristi*, which means to stand beside. Romans 12 says the same thing regarding presenting our bodies as a living sacrifice. In 2 Corinthians 1:24, Paul shows us that the stand we make as believers is by faith. He notes that preachers are fellow workers for your joy, helping you to take and maintain that faith stand.

We cannot have faith for you, but we can supply the knowledge, inspiration, and direction for you to take your stand. The preacher can provide the example and the exhortation, but you must do your part. As Paul told the Thessalonians, he was comforted by their faith stand because it proved they were standing fast in the Lord.

## The Principle of the Heart and Mouth

What makes for growth is the faith stand—the act of reckoning and presenting yourself as you are in Christ. Colossians 2:6 tells us that as we received Christ Jesus, so we should walk in Him. To understand how to walk in Him, we must look at the principle of faith found in Romans 10. 

Romans 10:9 states that if you confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, you will be saved. With the heart—meaning the mind—one believes, and with the mouth, confession is made. When the truth is preached and you understand it, you affirm it personally. That affirmation, in whatever form it takes, is what saves you.

This principle of faith—involving both the heart and the mouth—is the same principle at work in our growth. Jesus taught in Mark 11 that faith is of the heart and the mouth.
