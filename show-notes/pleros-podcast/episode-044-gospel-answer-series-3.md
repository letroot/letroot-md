# Gospel Answer Series 3

## The Gospel's Claim to Truth

Welcome back to the Gospel Answer Series. We are simply trying to present the answer that the gospel gives to the different matters of interest that it addresses. The very primary one is truth. The gospel makes this clear claim to be the truth in Ephesians 1:13, where Paul said, "We believed after we had the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation." He is saying the reason why you believe the gospel is because it proved itself to be the truth, and then you accepted it as such.

In our last episode, we settled that this is the truth about existence. You could say the truth of God, but at that point, you are already stating one of the answers as the question. He is not just giving us the answer to the truth of God or how God is; he is giving us the answer to the truth of existence. This is so important for the confidence of the believer because you must understand that the message of the gospel is giving you the navigation system about the world.

It is giving you the worldview and the way to think about the world, and it is not just doing so by imposition or merely dogmatically. We might eventually get to the realm of revelation, where we can see things that are held without empirical or logical evidence. However, it must first be built on the solid foundation of the gospel proving itself to be truth.

## The Lordship and Weight of Truth

If the gospel is truth, then it is Lord over all, even over those who do not believe it. This is the weight of truth. The lordship of the Word, the lordship of Christ Jesus, and the lordship of the gospel is premised on his truth, not just on an imposing claim that he makes of himself. If it is truth, then it is Lord over all, even over those who do not believe it.

A core text in this regard is 2 Corinthians 13:8, where Paul says that we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. Whatever anyone does against the truth is invariably for the truth. For example, if someone does not believe in gravity and acts against it, their action does not change the fact that they are still going to be affected by it. Gravity remains unmoved and unchanged about it.

The same thing is true for the gospel. At this juncture, we must ask: does the gospel prove, as it claims, to be the truth? Let us go back to our central text in Romans chapter 1. We have looked at Romans 1:16, where he calls the gospel the power of God for salvation to those who believe, for it reveals the righteousness of God.

## Suppressing the Evident Truth

In verse 18, we are told that those who do not believe are left to the rod of God because they are suppressing the truth. It makes quite a big claim that the reason why they are in that situation is their suppression of something that is evident to them. The very word "suppressed" already means he is saying it is there, but they are rejecting it. 

Verse 19 shows us why he is confident that this truth is on their hearts, stating, "Because what may be known of God was manifest in them." This "in them" refers to their minds, for God has shown it to them through observation. This combination of observation and reason is what leads to the conclusion of God.

## Observation and Reason in Creation

Verse 20 gives us the specific reason, noting that since the creation of the world, His invisible attributes are clearly seen. They are being understood and reasoned by the things that are made. There are two things Paul points out here. First, "since the creation of the world" implies the finitude of the world, using the time factor as a pointer.

Second, he argues that it is a world that is "made," which is a claim of the contingency of the world. The contingency of the world is proof that it must have come from God. This has been the standard procedure of the gospel in proving itself. This is why we believe in God—because we can observe and reason that there must be this conclusion of God by virtue of these factors. 

Truth is known by observation and reason. You know whether a book is blue by first observing it and then reasoning on what you see. What Paul said we observe is the finitude of the world and its contingency, which are things I will explain in subsequent videos. We will continue the Gospel Answer Series in the next one.
