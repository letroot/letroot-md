# The Mind of Man (Part 8)

Welcome to Plaro's podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Welcome back to the Pleros podcast. This is your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose for your life. We're looking at the mind of man and have seen a number of things. I think we are really getting into it now, and I do hope that you are following through and learning.

## The Centrality of the Mind in Spiritual Growth

We've seen what God's purpose is: sonship. He wants us to walk as His children and we have seen the road map of His purpose. We have also seen what it takes to fulfill it, which requires growth. We came to the conclusion that the mind is central to the fulfillment of God's purpose because growth happens in the mind. 

For that reason, we have been studying the mind of man. It is really not just a study on the mind, but a study on the reality of man and the entirety of who man is. The mind of man makes us ask questions about our spirit. If your mind is the determinant of our fulfillment of God's purpose, what place does our spirit hold? 

We have arrived at the conclusion that our spirit is one with Christ and fused entirely with God. We have the very life and nature of God, and our spirit is in a complete, perfect, and divine state that cannot be improved upon. Having said all of that, we still must bring everything home to the interaction that takes place between our spirit and our mind.

## Understanding the Whole Man: Spirit, Soul, and Body

We noted two texts that help us to entirely understand man. 1 Thessalonians 5:23 is an important text where it says, "may the God of peace sanctify you completely." It continues, "may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless until the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ." He says man is spirit, soul, and body.

Whilst we typically understand "soul" in that text to be the mind, we must not rush to the conclusion that soul simply means mind. The word itself doesn't mean mind either by the history of the word or by implication in scripture. There might be rare instances where it's used that way, but it would have to be a bit forced.

For example, James 1:21 says the word is "able to save your souls." That text can be used as mind in application, but it is really talking about the change of a person's life. Your life changes from what it was before to what God wants you to be. Whether you understand man as "spirit, soul, body" or "spirit, mind, body," the application still works.

## The Inward Man and the Persistence of the Mind

We can also better understand man as "inward man" and "outward man" based on 2 Corinthians 4:16. The inward man is the spirit with a mind, and we can think of the outward man as a body with a brain. This particular understanding helps us to appreciate how to grow as believers through parallels between the two.

In Luke 16, we see the story of Lazarus and the rich man. Even after the outward man was gone and the rich man was in Hades without his body, his inward man continued and still had a mind. He could recollect things, and Abraham told him, "Son, remember that in your lifetime..." 

The rich man told Abraham that he had five brothers and wanted to send Lazarus to warn them. His mindset remained the same even after he was without his physical body. This picture of the spirit with a mind is an awesome way of appreciating and understanding ourselves as humans.

## The Illustration of Feral Children

Let’s assume one takes a naturalistic standpoint. We have had historical situations involving feral children who were abandoned after birth and grew up among animals like orangutans. Because they don't grow up amongst humans, they do not learn language or walk on their feet as we do.

Feral children tend to have the same traits as the animals they are around. Their brains are wired and conditioned by that environment, and they only think of themselves as such. Their bodies are human, but their minds are entirely that of an animal because of their conditioning.

What we are witnessing in those cases is what happens a lot with believers spiritually. Their spirit is one with God and they are partakers of the divine nature, yet they were raised in "the wild" of the world. Believers may still have that same old mind even after repentance and recognition of who they are.

## Rewiring the Mind Through the Word

In the natural, we have few feral children, but in the spiritual, it is the opposite because everyone is saved from the wild. We come from the reign of sin and death into the family of God. The mind has been wired and conditioned by the world, and now it needs to be reprogrammed and restructured.

The feral child is just as human as any other human, but their conditioning is contrary to the condition of human living. It's the same thing with the believer upon salvation. You have the status and nature of a new creation, but a mind that is fresh off from the wild.

Renewing of the mind brings about the transformation necessary to fulfill purpose. We cannot do without the role of God's word on our mind to transform us. The word "spirit" in the Greek (*pneuma*) and Hebrew (*ruach*) simply means wind. This describes an unseen reality that is real and has a seen effect, just like the wind.
