# The Place of the Gospel in Your Life (Part 1)

You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Aki. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Welcome to the very first episode of the Pleros podcast. On this episode, I'll be sharing what I consider to be a very important subject matter. I think it's the best place for me to start. We'll be looking at what I'll title "The Place of the Gospel in Your Life."

The reason why I think it's important is that many people treat the gospel in different ways. To some people, the gospel is simply the message they believed when someone preached to them so they could be saved, and that is the end of the story. Some others treat the gospel as a Sunday affair, while others view it primarily as a solution to their personal problems. Is that the place that the gospel wants to hold in our lives?

## The Gospel as the Word of Truth

To answer that, I'm going to start with a very important text: Ephesians 1:13. Paul says, "In him you trusted after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation." Notice what he did there. He calls the gospel of salvation the "word of truth." The place that the gospel is claiming in our lives is not a random place; it is claiming to be the truth.

If the gospel is claiming to be the truth, it means it is claiming to be right. That is, it is always right. If someone says something is the truth, they are saying it is the correct reality of the matter. If you go and act like there is no gravity, you're going to see the implications of that reality regardless of what you believe. 

The place of truth is so important because it's a claim that what is being said is right. What the gospel is saying to everyone is, "I'm right; I'm the truth." Before these people believed, they heard the word of truth. The gospel was waving at them, asserting its status as the objective truth of their lives.

## The Unchangeable Nature of Truth

I want you to see a particular text that helps us appreciate what it means when something claims to be the truth. In 2 Corinthians 13:8, it says, "For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth." This is a serious text. It implies that even what you do against the truth still ultimately serves the truth.

Let’s go back to our gravity example. Imagine someone who has lived their entire life in a bubble where they use buttons to control whether they go up or down. When they step into the real world, someone tells them that things that go up must come down. The person might say they don't care what the law is, but what they believe doesn't count when truth is at play.

If you do not believe in gravity, it doesn't change the fact that it exists. If you do something against that fact, your actions will still have an effect that confirms the law of gravity. That is precisely the kind of place that the gospel holds in our lives. Whether you accept it or not, it still holds that place of truth, and you can do nothing against it.

## Proving Truth Through Reason and Observation

The kind of place we ought to give to the gospel is not just a one-time belief for salvation or a solution for a crisis. While there is a place for the power of God and the supernatural, that is not the primary place the gospel holds. The primary place is that it is the truth. However, the gospel does not claim to be truth through stubborn, dogmatic insistence.

It claims to be the truth on the grounds that it can prove itself to be so. That's what makes all the difference. You are sure the gospel is the truth the same way you are sure every other thing is true—through observation and reasoning. If you want to know if a phone is an iPhone or a Samsung, you observe its logo, its interface, and its functionalities.

When you observe and reason simultaneously, you are able to confirm the truth of what is before you. If you check a room to see what color shirt someone is wearing, you are using your senses and your mind to confirm reality. I'm going to show you that this is precisely what the gospel does. It does not simply impose itself; it invites you to see how it proves itself to be true.

## The Spectrum of the Christian Message

This claim of the gospel being truth is not only relevant at the point of salvation. In Ephesians 4:15, Paul speaks about the church leadership "speaking the truth in love." Later, in verse 21, he says that the truth is "in Jesus." Consistently across the spectrum of this message, everything is screaming out that it is the truth.

You must respect the gospel's place as truth. If you act without being mindful of this fact, it might cost you. It is like entering a field where you have been told there are landmines. If you are not mindful of that truth, your lack of awareness does not change the reality of the danger. You can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.

All the boasts of the gospel being the truth come down to its ability to prove its claims. It makes about five claims that it says it will prove by observation and reason. These claims are fundamental to your life: why you are here and who you are. We are going to get into these big issues starting with our text in Romans chapter one.

Romans 1:16 says, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ..." We will begin there as we dive into how the gospel proves itself to be the truth about your purpose and your identity. Let's turn our Bibles to Romans and see what the word says.
