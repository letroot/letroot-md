# The Reality of God's Purpose (Part 1)

Welcome to Pleros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

All right, brothers and sisters, welcome to another episode of the Pleros podcast. We have seen a couple of things already, and I think we are really getting to the core parts of what we want to start to look at within this podcast. As you know, we say it's a daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. That last part of the equation, God's purpose, is precisely what we are getting to now.

Before now, we have been seeing the place that the gospel holds in your life or in the life of any person whatsoever. The gospel makes this heavy claim to hold the place of truth in the life of everybody. It does this not just by imposing itself, but by proving itself to be the truth. We saw that it proves itself in different regards, including the reality of God by observation, the necessity of redemption, and the reality of the new creation.

## The Limitation of Observation and Reason

At the beginning of that particular study, I said there are about five things the gospel claims to be true that we must understand. We have seen three of them so far. Now the fourth one, which is going to open up another world of study to us, is the reality of God's purpose. One of the fundamental things we learn in the gospel is the reality of God's purpose.

I'm going to be starting from Ephesians chapter 1, which was the chapter we began the earlier study with. Paul said we believed on Jesus after we heard the word of truth, which is the gospel of our salvation. But before he said that, he mentioned many important things that make up the truth of the gospel. One of the primary things he said the gospel reveals to us is this subject matter of purpose.

Before I go any further, we have said anything that is truth is something that you can prove by observation and reason. Any claim of truth can be examined by our senses with our mind to confirm that it's actually so. However, there is one problem: there is one question of truth that cannot be proven by observation and reason. I want us to resolve that tension before we look at the next text.

## The Necessity of Revelation

I like using the example of seeing someone sleeping on a bed. If two people walk into a room and see a person fully covered on a bed, they might wonder what is there. One moves closer and sees it is a human being. They have answered the truth question "What's that on the bed?" through observation.

They can start to ask other questions about that person while they are still sleeping. They could take a blood sample and find out the person's genotype or history. You could even tell the person's name or social security number if you have the right systems. You can tell their height and weight without ever needing to wake them up or speak to them.

Despite all the things you can answer about that individual without speaking to them, one question you cannot answer is: what is the person trying to accomplish? You cannot know what someone is trying to do or what their purpose is except the person reveals it. This "why" question is a real thing with a real truth to it, yet it remains hidden. This is the unique area of truth that is exclusively known by revelation.

## Understanding the Mystery of God’s Will

This implies that even if we answer questions about God making the world or redemption through Jesus Christ, the burden remains. We may know we are new creations, which are all necessary things to know. Yet, the question remains: why are we here? This one question is not resolved by observation and reason; it can only be resolved by revelation.

This is exactly what Paul says in Ephesians chapter 1. In verse 9, he says that God has made known to us the mystery of His will. He had already explained that we are redeemed by Christ because God worked it out with His wisdom and prudence. Then he explains that this happened because God had first made known to us this mystery.

Usually, when people see the word "mystery," they think of esoteric information for a select group. However, the biblical use of mystery is pointing to information that simply requires revelation. Paul is saying that God’s will requires revelation to be known. Just as I cannot know your will unless you tell me, we cannot know God's will unless He makes it known.

## The Good Pleasure of Purpose

The text tells us that He has made known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure which He proposed in Himself. This is a lot to take in. He mentions the will, the good pleasure, and the big word: purpose. If he says the will is "according to" His good pleasure, it means the good pleasure preceded the will.

The word "good pleasure" in the original Greek is *eudokia*, which simply means what someone just likes or what seems good to them. Paul is saying that what God wants is according to what He likes. God's purpose was not forced on Him by any pressure. It is simply a matter of what He likes, which then became what He wants and what He determined to have.

God's purpose, His good pleasure, and His will are all the same thing in this context. We can use those words interchangeably. Paul tells us exactly what this purpose is in earlier verses. In Ephesians 1:5, it says He predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself. This act of predestination happened according to the good pleasure of His will.

Because of the good pleasure of God’s will, He predestined us to adoption as sons. This means that whatever the predestination was onto has to be the good pleasure of His will. We can therefore say that God’s will, good pleasure, and purpose is sonship. We will explain this concept of sonship further in the next episode.
