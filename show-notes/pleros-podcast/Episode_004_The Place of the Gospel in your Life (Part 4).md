# The Place of the Gospel in your Life (Part 4)

Welcome to Pleros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it. 

All right, brothers and sisters, we're on the third episode of the Pleros podcast. We are still looking at the place of the gospel in your life. I do hope by now that you are starting to see the place of the gospel in your life, not as just a one-off incident of salvation. For now, you might still be seeing it like that since you have just seen the reality of redemption fulfilled in Christ Jesus, but right now we're getting into more details. 

Just to have a short recap, the gospel claims to be truth. Ephesians 1:13 says you trusted after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. If the gospel is truth, it means two things: it is always right, and you can do nothing against it but for it. Even when you act against it, it is still for it because it's just going to take its toll in a negative manner towards the one acting against it, just as it would in a positive way for the one acting for it. 

## The Reality of the New Creation

If the gospel is truth, we need to see what it says and see it prove itself right. How do we know what is true? We prove that the same way we prove every other thing, which is by observation and reason. Whether you want to confirm someone's height or a measurement, observation and reason can make you know for sure what the truth is. 

We saw the reality of God being the first thing proven by observation and reason. Because of the finite and contingent nature of our world, there must be a cause that is equal or greater, which is God. We then proceeded to see the reality of redemption based on the contradiction in the world. Now we are going to be seeing a third truth that the gospel claims: the reality of the new creation.

The gospel says that now that you are saved by that work of redemption the Lord Jesus accomplished, you are now completely a new creation. You have been saved from death and from darkness. This means something has happened to you as an individual via the work that Christ has done. He has won the victory over sin, death, and darkness.

## From Darkness into Light

That work is now being fulfilled in stages, and the very first stage is what is fulfilled in you. The full defeat of sin and death will be at the consummation of redemption upon the coming of the Lord, where creation itself will be rid of these effects. But right now, the implication of redemption is fulfilled in us. Those of us who have believed have received the righteousness of God. 

Let's look at some texts that talk about this, starting with Ephesians 5:8 regarding light and darkness. The scripture says you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; therefore, walk as children of light. There has been a fundamental change to our nature. We must be careful because people can claim to be light on their own premise without the gospel, but if you are witnessing the contradiction in the world, that is just untruth altogether.

In John 5:24, the Lord Jesus says that he who hears his words and believes has eternal life and shall not come into judgment. He says you have passed from death to life. The moment you believe in Jesus, you aren't "passing"—you have already passed. Colossians 1:13 further confirms that He has delivered us from the authority of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of His son.

## The Work of the Spirit

One of the major things you have to recognize is that the reality of the new creation is strongly emphasized. Something has changed about you; the old flesh and darkness are gone. You might say, "I still find myself in thoughts or actions that make me think I'm the same old person," but we are going to get to that. For now, understand that if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.

According to 1 Corinthians 12:13, by one spirit we were all baptized into one body. You became "in Christ" by the spirit of God putting you into the body of Christ. Being a new creation means old things have passed away. They aren't just "passing away" like a work in progress; in terms of your nature, you are already completely as Christ is. 

When the Bible says old things have passed away, it means all of them. That is why all things have become new and all things are of God. At salvation, nothing in the natural changed—your body remains the same—but that is because you are thinking about yourself in just one way. There is a dual reality to humanity that we must examine for the fulfillment of God's purpose.

## The Inward and Outward Man

In 2 Corinthians 4:16, Paul says that though our outward man is perishing, our inward man is being renewed day by day. The outward man is your body, which grows old and decays. The inward man is your spirit, which never ages. Paul makes a distinction between this outward tent and the inward man that became entirely new the moment you believed the gospel.

Your inward man used to be the "old man" or the flesh, but that is completely gone. It used to be darkness and death, but now it is completely light and life. You need to get that deep into your heart. You are new by the spirit of God. I will hang it there for now regarding the new creation, as we move toward the reality of God's purpose.

## Discovering God's Purpose

What is God's purpose? Why are you on earth? Why do you have life and breath in you? You just found yourself here and didn't even know the day you were born. Then, some seven or eight years later, something kicked in along the way and you started wondering what was going on in this world.

I remember reaching that point and asking how I even got here. I followed the chain of birth back until I thought about God and wondered who gave birth to God. My mind was just roaming, trying to find the point of it all. Sometimes we get vague answers about following our passions or hunger, but those answers lack objective confidence.

We need to know the truth about why we exist. If you go about creating your own purpose while ignoring God's, that is a form of idolatry. If God created the world, He created it for His purpose. Determining your own purpose is like trying to take His place as God. There is an objective answer to what God's purpose is, and that is what we will focus on.
