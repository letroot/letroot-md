# The Reality of Sonship and Purpose

Welcome to Pleros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it. 

All right, brothers and sisters. Welcome to another episode of the Pleros podcast, your daily dose of God's word, transforming you to fulfill God's purpose. We've seen quite some things already and want to make some progress today. We have seen the place that the gospel holds in our life is a place of truth. 

We have seen the reality of God's purpose in this question of truth and we have found that God's purpose is sonship. We have explained that sonship has two realities in it: the first is that we are children of God and the second is that we are heirs of God. In this particular episode, we are continuing our study on the pursuit of purpose.

## A Sense of Significance in God's Work

We are not here trying to find out about God's purpose; we have done that. We are looking more into how exactly do we pursue, or what exactly do we do? How do we start, and what is the next step? A lot of the emphasis I've made has been on recognizing the significance of your place or your part in God's purpose.

It's one thing to have received the gospel and another to have accepted the reality of God's purpose. But even when people do that, you find that they have a general attitude of indifference. They are not really as driven as they ought to be, as though they have a wrong understanding of what purpose entails. 

Particularly when we talk about being heirs of God, you'll find that the recognition of our inheritance in the life of the Lord Jesus and in the life of Paul was quite different from what obtains with some people. The Lord had the sense of having something to finish; He must finish the work that has been given to Him. We find a similar sense with Paul as well in Acts chapter 20 and verse 24.

## The Exclusivity of Your Calling

Paul said, "None of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself that I may finish my race with joy, the ministry which I received of the Lord to testify of the gospel of the grace of God." He centered on his spiritual assignment in God's purpose as his race. It was very clearly with a sense of wanting to finish the race that the Lord had given him. 

He had a very serious sense of significance about himself that we are meant to have about ourselves as well. One of the texts I've been looking at is 1 Corinthians chapter 7 and verse 17. Here Paul said, "As God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk." 

There is that which God has parted to you, and that is very specific. There's what He has parted to you just like He has what He has parted to me or to someone else. Recognizing that it is parted to each one should register on us that sense of exclusivity and a weight of significance. If your portion is not done, it means it stays undone except you do it.

## Starting Where You Are

It doesn't matter if another person is doing something that is bigger in quantity or more visible in impact. If you do not do your part, your part goes undone. While God will still work out the fulfillment of His plan one way or the other, it should be the case that in Him allotting a part to you, you are faithful to that part. 

Whatever condition you found that you were called in, let each one abide in that calling where he was called. This is the rule that was given about how we walk in the faith and in God's purpose. You start from there. The state you were in whilst called has been taken into account by God, and He doesn't place an extra burden on you.

Whether you were called while circumcised or uncircumcised, it is a non-issue in your walk with God. Paul points out different identity markers or status signifiers that people have, but keeping the commandment of God is what matters. In verse 20, he says, "Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called."

## Diligence in Natural Assignments

This applies to our natural assignments as well. Were you called a slave? Do not be concerned about it, but if you can be made free, rather use it. He who is called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord's freedman, and he who is called while free is Christ's slave. You were bought at a price, so you should have the recognition that you are serving Christ.

The first rule when it comes to our natural assignment is to start where you are. It could be that you are an employee, an employer, a freelancer, or a student. Whatever condition you found yourself in at the point of salvation and enlightenment, that is where you are to start. Abide in that calling and maintain that identity as you carry out His way.

If you are currently unemployed, you must still get your hands working at all costs. You should either be interning or making your "job" the act of looking for a job, but you shouldn't be doing nothing. God's word encourages us to hold what we do naturally as part of His assignment. Do not be idle; you must be working and taking advantage of every opportunity to be better.
