# The Place of the Gospel in Your Life (Part 3)

This episode continues our discussion on the vital subject: the place of the gospel in your life. We have established that the gospel's true position is not determined by our preferences, but by its own claim to be truth. If the gospel asserts itself as truth, it implies it is always correct; nothing can ultimately stand against it. Even actions taken in opposition to it ultimately serve its purpose, albeit with negative consequences. Therefore, accepting the gospel as truth requires serious consideration in two ways: first, discerning its claims to be truth, and second, verifying those claims.

Truth is discerned through observation and reason. This is how we identify everyday realities, such as the type of phone someone uses or the color of their shirt. The gospel states that its truth can be known in precisely the same manner. This approach was taught by Paul, guided by the Holy Spirit. Ephesians 1:13 highlights this: "you trusted in Jesus after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of salvation." Your faith in the gospel, then, is fundamentally rooted in its claim to be truth.

## The Gospel's Foundational Truth and the Reality of God

Our previous discussion in Romans chapter 1 revealed the gospel's first truth claim: the undeniable reality of God. Paul declared he was "not ashamed of the gospel" because it reveals both the righteousness and the wrath of God. Belief in the gospel leads to experiencing God's righteousness, while suppressing its truth leads to experiencing His wrath. Paul argued that the truth of God's existence should be evident to all, yet many reject it. He provided evidence and concluded on the reality of God. For a more detailed exploration of this, refer to teachings on pleros.org or the Pleros Perfecting Course.

If the gospel claims to be truth, we must take its claims seriously and align our lives accordingly. The second major claim it makes is the reality of redemption, fully accomplished in Christ. This claim, too, is grounded in observation and reason – specifically, the inherent contradictions we witness in the world around us. We live in a world marked by what the Bible calls "sin." While our minds often immediately associate sin with individual human actions, God's word frequently uses the term to describe a fundamental state or condition contrary to what is right and good. Consider sickness: stating someone is sick implies there is an ideal state of health they ought to possess. The condition of sickness is contrary to that ideal, and this is something universally observable.

## The World's Contradiction and the Need for Redemption

We exist in a world of contradiction and sin, a reality that often perplexes us, especially when we acknowledge the existence of God. The contradictions we observe are akin to the stark difference between sickness and health: an original, ideal state followed by a subsequent condition that is the absence of that ideal. To further illustrate, consider light and darkness. Darkness is not an inherent original reality; it is defined by the absence of light. Where light is, darkness cannot coexist. Similarly, in the realm of life and death, death is the absence of life. When a creature is dead, it signifies the cessation of life.

Clearly, something has gone fundamentally wrong, introducing a reality contrary to the original, intended order. Whether viewed conceptually, intuitively, or morally, an undeniable brokenness pervades our world. We describe it in various ways—a "broken world" or a "fallen world"—all attempting to grasp the problem of evil. Yet, the fundamental reality remains: our world is in a state of contradiction and sin, and it desperately needs redemption.

When we speak of redemption, many people initially focus solely on their personal actions. However, the gospel clarifies that the deeper issue precedes individual deeds. We are born into a state of bondage to sin. It's like being born into slavery, such as the Israelites under Egyptian rule; the situation itself is the problem, not primarily one's individual missteps within that bondage. This is not about inherited guilt or a genetic flaw, but a pervasive condition of captivity from which humanity requires liberation. At its inception, humanity's rejection of God's purpose plunged all of creation into this bondage of sin. This condition necessitates salvation.

## Christ: The Just and Complete Solution

If someone offered a way out of prison, a wise person would listen to the solution before demanding a full explanation of how they got there. Analogously, if darkness pervades, the only true solution is the restoration of light. If death dominates, the only remedy is the restoration of life. The problem we witness has one singular solution: the reintroduction of the original light and life that was rejected. This means God Himself must be restored to our world to resolve the profound contradiction.

Crucially, God must resolve this contradiction justly, because humanity's choice initiated the problem. This is precisely why redemption is found in Christ Jesus. God Himself entered into humanity's predicament to bear the consequences. This problem of spiritual death and darkness is inherently degenerative, leading from spiritual mortality to physical death, and ultimately to a "second death." We cannot afford to trivialize this degenerative effect or the impending reality of perishing.

Deliverance from this problem is precisely what the forgiveness of sins offers. God became human in the person of Jesus so that He could justly bear the consequences of the second death on our behalf. He willingly died on the cross to exhaust these consequences and was then raised from the dead by His inherent power of life. This philosophically necessary need for salvation was not only prophetically promised throughout history but found its perfect fulfillment in the person of Jesus. Anyone who grasps this truth and believes in it is saved.

The second profound truth claimed by the gospel is this reality of redemption, fully accomplished in Christ. I earnestly encourage anyone who has not yet believed to do so now. It is as straightforward as articulating, "Lord Jesus, I recognize my need for salvation. I understand that You have provided it by becoming human and atoning for this brokenness, and I now place my faith in You to be saved."
