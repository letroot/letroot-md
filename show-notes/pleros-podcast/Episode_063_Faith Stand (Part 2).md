# Faith Stand (Part 2)

Welcome to Pleros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Welcome back to the Pleros podcast. We are still serving you your daily dose of God's word, transforming you to fulfill God's purpose, and we are presently studying the faith stand. Of course, we have seen a lot of things that led up to this. We have seen what God's purpose is and the road map to achieving it. We have seen that growth or maturity happens by discipleship and the perfection of the saints. 

That growth happens in the mind, and we have studied all the aspects of the mind. We saw that one part of the mind particularly is responsible for our work, our conduct, and our action. That part of the mind became our central focus at the end of the former episodes on the mind of man. Addressing that part of our mind is why we are now studying the faith stand.

## The Difference Between Conviction and Reckoning

It is one thing to have conviction in our mind and another thing to have the reckoning or the consciousness of our conviction. A critical text in this regard is Romans 6, and another is James 1. In Romans chapter 6, Paul says in verse three, "Do you not know," which is rhetorical, that as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 

Romans 6:6 says, "Knowing this, that the old man was crucified with Christ." Again, Romans 6:9 says, "Knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more." Three times he is assuming and affirming the knowledge that they already have. However, by the time he gets to verse 11, he switches gears. 

He says, "Likewise, you also reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin." He is no longer concerned about their knowledge; he is focused on what they are doing with that knowledge. It is one thing to know, and another thing entirely to be reckoning in the light of the knowledge of God’s word that you have.

## Standing Beside the Reality of Christ

The word "reckon" in the Greek is *logizomai*, which means to take account or to put into account. An accountant in a business does not account for things that are not there. There must be a reality present, and then the accountant records it or takes note of the inventory. It is one thing to have love, righteousness, or power in you, but it is a different ball game to actually be reckoning it.

In verse 13, he uses a different word: "present." This word is key and core to the faith stand. The word "present" in the Greek is *paristemi*, from *para* (beside) and *histemi* (to stand). It means to "stand beside." When you are standing beside a reality, you are not creating it or making it so. You are simply recognizing and affirming it.

It is like acknowledging every good thing that is in you in Christ. You are pointing to the realities and saying, "I am a new creation; this is who I am." It is very important that we have that appreciation of the reality of who we are. We are to present ourselves—stand beside ourselves—as dead to sin and alive to God.

## Transformation Through the Renewing of the Mind

You should have a disposition as a believer where you are presenting yourself as you truly are. You say things like, "I am the righteousness of God. The only thing I can do is righteousness." By reinforcing your identity in Christ, you move away from slaves of uncleanness and lawlessness. Presenting yourself as new is what causes you to walk as such.

This concept comes up again in Romans 12:1, where Paul beseeches us to present our bodies as a living sacrifice. This is your "reasonable service" or your logical, rational worship. Now that your nature has changed and you are a new creation, the logical step that follows is to stand beside who you are. 

Romans 12:2 then tells us not to be conformed to this world but to be transformed by the renewing of our mind. Renewing the mind here is not just putting in new information. While knowledge enlightens the mind, renewing is a continuous refreshing. It is a matter of presenting or reckoning yourself, which brings about the transformation that causes us to walk.

## Establishing the Faith Stand

Transformation is what makes for our walk. It is possible for a child to have the ability to do something but lack the capacity because some development is needed. Similarly, the nature and knowledge may be there, but growth and transformation make you able to do what you are supposed to do. This transformation happens by the renewing of the mind.

This act of standing is an act of faith. In 2 Corinthians 1:24, Paul says, "Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are fellow workers for your joy; for by faith you stand." Every time we are told to stand beside who we are, to affirm our identity, or to reckon, it is actually a stand of faith. 

Instructions to stand are instructions to have a faith stand. We are going to take up from here in the next episode. We trust you were blessed by today’s episode.
