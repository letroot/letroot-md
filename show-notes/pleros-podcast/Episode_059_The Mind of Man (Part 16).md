# The Mind of Man (Part 16)

Welcome back to another episode of the Pleros podcast. This is still your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose for your life. There is nothing more fundamental than for a believer to recognize that they exist for God's purpose. Our conviction, our philosophy, our theology, our worldview, and our persuasion affects the whole of our life. 

Once we recognize the truth that we are here as a result of God and have been redeemed by the work of the Lord Jesus Christ, we must answer the question of why we are here. We have seen that a more developed answer to that question is sonship. Sonship is an encompassing word that entails the fact that we are children of God called to fellowship with our Father, relating with one another as siblings while walking in our divine nature and character.

Sonship also includes the fact that we have assignments to do and an inheritance to claim. We could think of the inheritance as God's Spirit or the entirety of creation. Very personally, we should also recognize we have the inheritance of our natural assignment as well as our spiritual assignment. We need to be ruthlessly focused and devoted on the assignments that God has given us to do. 

## The Necessity of Discipleship

We are presently studying the mind of man, having already looked at the roadmap of God's purpose. We know His purpose and the journey it unfolds, but the next phase is learning how to fulfill it. Having direction does not automatically mean we are doing the purpose. Walking the path without actually doing what you should do means you will get to the destination without any result, which is not God’s will. 

To bear the burden of God's purpose, there is a need for discipleship and the perfecting of the saints. The challenge without discipleship is that you could follow the roadmap but do so from the wrong heart, mind, or spirit. This often leads to doing the work out of selfish ambition rather than God's ambition. While personal ambition can be God's ambition, selfish ambition is entirely about self.

We are judged not only for our actions but also for our motives and the state of our hearts. This is where discipleship helps us to fix the state of our heart. If we need discipleship and the perfecting of the saints, we must ask where this growth and development actually happens. While we often use the term "spiritual growth," the growth actually happens in our mind.

## Defining the Inward and Outward Man

Our spirit is in a perfect, complete, and divine state; there is no improving or developing the human spirit after salvation. When we are joined to the Lord, we are one spirit with Him, so the idea that there is more to do to our spirit is incorrect. However, our spirit is not all there is to us. To think about ourselves as humans in a wholesome manner, we must pay attention to Paul's description of the inward and outward man.

The inward man can be described as a spirit with a mind, which also has a body with a brain. Our mind holds both natural and spiritual information, or what we might call physical and metaphysical data. For example, if someone teaches you science or commerce, the subject matter is natural and secular. However, underneath that basic teaching will always be the philosophical and spiritual persuasion of the person teaching.

Whether a person holds a Christian, atheistic, agnostic, or pantheistic worldview, that perspective is going to seep through what they are teaching. Our worldview and persuasion are always present in our speaking, thinking, and engagement. In school settings, we are supposed to be taught what is natural, while our beliefs are formed by family and religious institutions. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that people's metaphysical persuasions invariably find a way to seep through.

## From Knowledge to Consciousness

Our focus has been on the seven aspects of the human mind to understand why we act the way we do. We have concluded that our actions are a matter of our consciousness rather than just our knowledge or conviction. We don't necessarily do what we know; we do what we are conscious of. The first aspect of the mind is reasoning, where we put details together and think through a matter.

The second aspect is memory, which retains information in the short-term or long-term. The third aspect is our will, which allows us to agree or disagree once evidence is shown to us. Even when sufficient evidence of God is provided, some may still refuse to accept it due to intellectual dishonesty or inconsistency. When a person finally accepts the evidence, what began in their reasoning and memory becomes a conviction through their will.

However, your conviction is one thing, but your actions do not always come from there. You can know something and still act contrary to that knowledge. This is a critical distinction to make as we look at the scriptures. James 1:21 tells us to lay aside all wickedness and receive the engrafted word which is able to save our souls. This word is like a seed planted in our heart that is meant to grow.

## The Power of Reckoning and Renewal

James tells us to be doers of the word and not hearers only. This is not just about a momentary exercise of the will; it is about the entirety of a man's life expressing the word. If you are a genuine doer, you will express the word even when you aren't conscious of the need to do so. For example, when someone offends you at work, your reaction depends on what is dominant in your consciousness.

What makes a man just a hearer is that he is "reckoning aside" or deceiving himself. The hearer knows the word and may even agree with it, but the problem lies in his reckoning. You can be convinced that you are a new creation but still be conscious of something else. Romans 6:11 instructs us to "reckon" ourselves dead to sin and alive to God. This is an act of insisting on the reality of who we are in Christ.

This act of affirming and reckoning who we are is what the Bible calls the renewing of the mind. It is not just the information itself that transforms us, but the constant refreshing of our consciousness. This reckoning is what produces our emotions and our reactions. What truly changes you is presenting and affirming the new man you are in Christ, specifically within your consciousness. This study of consciousness will lead us directly into our next study on faith.
