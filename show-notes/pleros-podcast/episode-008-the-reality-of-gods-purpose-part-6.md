# The Reality of God's Purpose (Part 6)

We are still unearthing God's purpose for our life. We have seen thus far that God's purpose is sonship. Ephesians 1:9 states that God has made known to us what he desires. Ephesians 1:5 clarifies that what he desires is sonship. Romans 8 explains sonship as being God's child and God's heir. The spirit of sonship, when examined, reveals these two realities.

First, we are children of God. The Greek word *technon* (from *titco*) signifies being birthed or reproduced by God. Second, as a child of God, we are an heir of God.

## Understanding Our Inheritance as Heirs

We have been exploring what it means to be heirs of God. The term "heir" means one who has been assigned something by another. Therefore, if we say we are an heir, the natural questions are "of whom?" and "of what?" This is particularly relevant when we declare ourselves heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.

Paul addresses this question in Romans chapter 8. After discussing our status as heirs of God, the subsequent verses explain how creation itself benefits from our identity. One might miss the connection between our sonship and its implications for creation if the concept of heirship isn't fully grasped. Paul's message indicates that our being heirs grants us ownership and management rights over creation. The direction we take, and our very nature, will ultimately influence our inheritance and impact creation.

This understanding leads to Romans 8:19, which states, "For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the manifestation of the sons of God." Here, creation is personified, eagerly anticipating the moment when the sons of God will express their true identity, affecting their mortal bodies and, by extension, all creation. This clearly shows that as heirs of God, the sons of God possess authority and rights over creation.

## The Scope of God's Allotment

Currently, existence can be categorized into two main types: the self-existent God ("I am that I am") and created existence, which comprises the natural world made by God. If God is to allot anything to anyone, He is not allotting Himself per se. While we speak of God giving us His Spirit and His nature, which are indeed allotted to us, we cannot "own" God as a person. However, the Spirit of God can be considered part of what God has allotted to us as inheritors, and scripture supports this.

When people focus solely on texts that speak of the Spirit as our inheritance, they sometimes miss the specific implication of *which* Spirit God gave us: the Spirit of Sonship. This means that even within the gift of the Spirit, there is a responsibility. The Spirit of Sonship inherently points to our status as heirs of God, and as heirs, there is something tangible that God is allotting to us through this very Spirit.

Therefore, we cannot separate this reality of inheritance from merely having God's nature. There is something specific we possess as God's own. As joint heirs with Christ, we are said to inherit "all of creation."

## Joint and Individual Inheritance

In law, concepts like "severed inheritance" and "joint inheritance" exist. When scripture says we are "joint heirs with Christ," it refers to a joint inheritance—something we co-inherit with Christ. All believers co-inherit with Christ. Hebrews 1:1-3 speaks of Christ being the heir of all things, demonstrating His lordship over all creation. As co-heirs with Christ, we too are inseparable from the reality that we own all of creation. God is assigning His creation to us.

Matthew 5:5 declares, "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth." This statement connects our faith and meekness—our recognition of need and acceptance of redemption in Christ—with ownership of the earth. The Beatitudes consistently highlight a theme of need and seeking. The poor in spirit, the meek, the hungry—all recognize a fundamental need that Christ fulfills.

Thus, as those of faith, we own the earth, jointly with Christ, and as heirs of God. What does God own? Creation. What do we own with Him? Creation. What does Christ own? Creation. He has redeemed creation from the grip of death and darkness, securing the rights to it through His victory over sin, death, and darkness. Now, owned by Christ, and because we are joint heirs with Him, we own creation. We are destined to bring God's nature and His desired goals of life and light upon creation.

## Our Natural and Spiritual Assignments

Is this all there is to our inheritance? Does it impact our purpose here and now? What are we meant to do as the Creator's design on this earth?

Within our joint inheritance of creation, there is also the concept of a "severed inheritance," where this joint inheritance is divided among different individuals. This implies both a natural and a spiritual individual inheritance.

Colossians 3:22 to 4:1 addresses this: "Bondservants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not with eye service, as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing God." In contemporary terms, this applies to employees. Our obedience to our employers is rooted in our reverence for God.

"Whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ." Your natural work becomes an act of service to the Lord. Your faithfulness to your boss acknowledges that your boss has been placed there by the Lord. Just as God provides spiritual leadership for your growth, He also places individuals to guide you in your earthly assignments.

Therefore, how faithful are you with your natural assignments? God has given you work to do. Do not handle it carelessly, lightly, or loosely. Take it with all seriousness. There is a natural assignment the Lord has given you.
