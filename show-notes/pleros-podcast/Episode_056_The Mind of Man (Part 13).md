# The Mind of Man (Part 13)

Welcome to Plaro's podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Welcome back to the Pleos podcast. This is your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose for your life. We are committed to seeing that happen as the Lord helps us. Now, we've been studying the subject matter, the mind of man.

## The Race of God’s Purpose

On the premise of things we have seen like what God's purpose is for your life, sonship, he wants you to walk as his child as well as his heir. As his child, he wants you to walk in fellowship with him, in his nature and character. As his heir, he wants you to carry out the assignments he has for you. This includes your natural assignment as well as your spiritual assignment, which should be treated as priority by function of its worth and weight.

Knowing that we have God's purpose to fulfill, there's a road map of how we fulfill that purpose. There's the journey, and that's why we often see the word for "race" used when talking about the gospel. Paul says in 2 Timothy 4:7, "I have finished the race," and Hebrews 12:1 tells us to run with patience the race that is set before us. There is a path to take, but knowing the path doesn't take away the fact that you need the strength for the race.

## The Mind as the Seat of Spiritual Growth

We still need to know how we are built, prepared, developed, and discipled to be able to bear the burden of his purpose. Eventually, we come to the conclusion that the place where growth happens is our mind, not our spirit. Our nature is already 100% like our Father’s, and we are one spirit with the Lord. Our spirit and the spirit of God are fused together; we are new creations.

All of these things speak to our spirit being in a 100% complete, perfect, divine state that you cannot improve upon. Usually, when we say the term "going up spiritually," we could mistake that for something happening to our spirit. However, the most accurate way of depicting it is that our spirit is not any less than what any other believer's spirit is. The difference in our walk is a matter of our mind, and that's where our attention ought to be.

## Metaphysical Influence in the Physical World

Taking a biblical worldview, the best way to think of ourselves as human beings is as a spirit with a mind, having a body with a brain. The brain or mind will do a lot of natural stuff that has zero spiritual implication, such as studying physics, chemistry, or biology. You are just studying matter as it is. Yet, our mind doesn't just deal with physical matters; it inescapably deals with metaphysical matters.

When someone is teaching you physical sciences, they are often unable to separate their metaphysical persuasions from what they are saying. Whether they have a complete disregard for any divine correlation or hold a divine correlation, it is going to show one way or the other. It happens with commerce and art as well, where your ethics and spiritual influence seep into the communication. We must be aware that while we deal with natural things, people are constantly communicating spiritual influences to us.

## Understanding the Faculty of the Mind

Man is a spirit with a mind and a body with a brain. We have looked at major texts describing this, such as 2 Corinthians 4:16 regarding the inward and outward man. Now we are trying to look into the aspects and compartments of the mind. We saw that there are two major Greek words for mind: *no* as well as the word *dianoia*.

*Dianoia* is often used to show the state of your knowing or the concluded state of your reasoning. For instance, when the Lord said you should love the Lord with all your mind, it means it should be your persuasion and the conclusion of your reasoning. In Luke 24:45, the word *no* was used when Jesus "opened their understanding," focusing on the reasoning part and removing the blinds through his explanation.

We see an interplay between these terms in Ephesians 4:17-18, where it says not to walk in the "futility of their mind" and having their "understanding darkened" (dianoia). The concluded state of their mind is without light and opposed to the truth in Christ. In contrast, Ephesians 1:18 prays that the "eyes of your understanding" (dianoia) be enlightened. This means it has become your conviction that you are a new creation.

## From Conviction to Conduct

So far, we have seen four aspects of the mind: reasoning, memory, the will, and conviction. The conviction part requires free will, where you must have the will upon examination to agree or disagree with the information you've been exposed to. My reasoning offers a decision to my will, and it is the act of our will to agree with what we see to be true. At this juncture, we see that we reason, we have memory, and our will leads to our conviction.

In Romans 6, Paul points out what happens to the mind of man at different junctures. He asks, "Do you not know?" regarding being baptized into Christ’s death, implying that they should have already agreed with this truth. These people have accepted the grace of God but are wondering if that means they should continue in sin. They know the reality of redemption, but they have not known what to do with that knowledge.

Paul is pointing out that there is a step after knowing and a step after conviction on the mind. There is another part of our mind that produces our results, and it happens to be the case that it's not just our conviction that produces our work. If we don't realize what causes our work, we will keep struggling with our walk. Catch you on the next one.
