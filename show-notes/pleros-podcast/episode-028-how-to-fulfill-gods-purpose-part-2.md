We have established that God's ultimate purpose for our lives is sonship. The redemptive work of Jesus Christ was designed to restore us to this original purpose. When we are saved, our joy should extend beyond mere deliverance from damnation to a profound understanding of *why* our salvation was so crucial to the Father and the Lord. We were not simply saved *from* something; we were saved *for* something: the eternal purpose for which we were created—the purpose of sonship.

We have examined what sonship entails and what it means to be God's child. It signifies a call to fellowship with Him, to walk in His nature and character, primarily fulfilled through a life of prayer and devotion.

As heirs of God, we are also entrusted with specific assignments. Possessing God's Spirit is akin to God assigning His entire nature to us. In one sense, you are an heir of God because you possess the Spirit of God—the very Spirit of sonship. Within this Spirit resides the reality of being an heir, with something divinely allotted to you. At this stage, you can truly say the entirety of creation is allotted to you as a joint inheritance, as scriptures declare that the meek inherit the earth and Abraham is heir of the world.

Beyond this broad reality of joint inheritance, there is also individual or specific inheritance. Across scripture, we discern both our natural inheritance and our spiritual inheritance, which encompass both natural and spiritual assignments. Having explored these concepts, it is now crucial to understand how we actively pursue God's purpose and our specific assignments.

## Principles Guiding Natural Assignments

For our natural assignment, five key principles guide our approach:
1.  **Start Where You Are:** Begin by leveraging your current circumstances.
2.  **Seize Opportunities:** Take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
3.  **Utilize Resources:** Engage with the world's resources as you are able.
4.  **Remain Spirit-Led:** Always stay open to the leading of the Holy Spirit.
5.  **Maximize Productivity:** Ensure you are making the most of every opportunity and remaining maximally productive.

Our spiritual assignment begins with a committed discipleship within a local church community. God consistently orchestrates our steps towards spiritual family, as Psalm 68 declares, "He sets the solitary in families." Your faithfulness and commitment to this community are vital, unless divine leading, clearly communicated through the truth of the Word and the Holy Spirit, directs you elsewhere. God does not leave you without guidance or suggest that you forgo local church fellowship entirely.

## Reaching More People and Maturing into Leadership

Beyond this foundational commitment, you are called to "go" and reach more people, whether through physical outreach or virtual means. This involves clearly understanding your mandate: to preach, proclaim, and publicize the message. Subsequently, you are to disciple those who receive the message and persist in these efforts until you mature into leadership. This path, exemplified by figures like Priscilla, Erastus, and Onesimus, allows you to fully live a life of purpose.

## The Mandate to Know and Prepare for God's Will

To further understand how we fulfill these assignments, we turn to a pivotal text in Luke chapter 12. It states that "the servant who knew his master's will and did not prepare himself or do according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes. But he who did not know, yet committed things deserving of stripes, shall be beaten with few. For everyone to whom much is given, from him much will be required."

This passage made a profound impression on me years ago. The second verse particularly highlights that the burden of knowing rests squarely on the individual. From that moment, I understood I had no right to outsource the responsibility of knowing God's will to someone else. You are not absolved of the duty to verify the truth of what you are taught. It is your responsibility to seek clarity and genuinely know the Master's will, for even one who does not know will still face judgment for their ignorance.

## Preparing Your Heart to be Salt and Light

Our current focus is on the servant who knew the master's will but failed to prepare. As a diligent student of this teaching, you have already passed the initial phase: you know God's will. You understand you are His child, called to fellowship and devotion, and that He has both natural and spiritual assignments for you. There is no longer room to pretend ignorance.

Now that you possess this knowledge, the scripture emphasizes the need to "prepare and do according to His will." Notice the sequence: "prepare" precedes "do." This presents a challenge, as even with academic degrees and improved skills, there is still a need for a *specific* type of preparation. We are referring to a preparation nurtured by the church, which ultimately influences your actions in the natural world.

This preparation is not solely about advancing a Christian agenda to remove all darkness, but primarily about preparing your heart to be salt and light. We are called to be examples and preservers against decadence and corruption in society. The preparation for your spiritual assignment, as outlined in Ephesians chapter 4, involves a training that ensures we are capable of fulfilling the purpose God has for our lives. We will delve deeper into this next time.
