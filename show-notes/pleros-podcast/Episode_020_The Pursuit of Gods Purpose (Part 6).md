# The Pursuit of God's Purpose (Part 6)

Welcome to Pleros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akin. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Your daily dose of God's word transforming you, renewing your mind to fulfill God's purpose for your life. I trust you'll be learning. We've seen some important things and I'm just going to rush through them. We have seen that the gospel holds the place of truth in our lives, in fact in existence, such that those who reject it are still affected by its truth.

## The Foundation of Sonship and Purpose

The second thing we have seen is that the gospel answers all the different questions of truth. But at the heart of that, or at the end of it, is the question of why. Why is there anything at all? Why do we exist, or why is there created or contingent existence? And we've seen that the answer is God's purpose, which is sonship.

We have explained sonship to mean being God's child and His heirs. If speaking about one person plural, God's intention was a family; it is to be God's children and to be His heirs. As His children, we are to fellowship with Him and walk in His nature and character. Then, as His heirs, we are to carry out the assignment that He gives to us.

We have seen that there are two assignments that we have: natural assignment and spiritual assignment. Those are the basic things we have gotten out of the way. But it's not enough that we just know about God's purpose. Ordinarily, what should follow from that is asking, "How do I fulfill it? What am I supposed to do about it?"

## Walking in the State of Your Calling

The pursuit of God's purpose is not something that is just left to us to think out on our own. Even though if we think through it, we could probably arrive at the same conclusion, God's providence and orchestration address how we navigate it. His revelation, His written word, and the scriptures directly address how we navigate the pursuit of His purpose.

A central text in that regard is 1 Corinthians 7:17, where he said, "Just as God has parted to us and as God has called us, that's how we should walk." It's talking about the conditions in which a man receives the gospel or realizes God's purpose. These are the conditions God already foreknew for him to begin his walk in his purpose.

Your walk in the new life in Christ is not such as to begin with you trying to fix one thing or another about your conditions. Now, it is about fixing or repenting and abandoning sins, which is a different thing. We're talking about fixing circumstances or conditions. That's not how we are told; it rather starts with you walking from the state in which you are called.

Verse 20 of that 1 Corinthians 7 says, "Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called." So you start out from there. It's again talking about the conditions. He had started out talking about marital conditions. If the person was already married, probably even married to an unbelieving person, it says God is well aware.

## Natural Assignments and the Liberty of Choice

Brethren, let each one remain with God in that state in which he was called. Now you recall that he would give exceptions in some instances, particularly in a natural assignment. When you can make progress, that's an exception. But if it's about things like your identity, if you are changing them for the faith, you are probably walking in the flesh.

Your status in such regard doesn't count, except in matters of personal desire. You should begin your walk with God from the state in which you are called, which includes the state of your natural assignment. The second rule from starting from where you are is to take advantage of opportunities if you can be made free.

Where you do have such an opportunity, use it. The third counsel is found in verse 31, where he says those who use this world as not misusing it. This speaks to those who have a level of privilege beyond constraints of circumstances or limitations of opportunity to freely choose what they want to do.

When it comes to natural assignment, we must recognize that liberty of choice to choose and to act as we want to. Everything in life is open to the leading of the Spirit, but the leading of the Spirit in our natural assignment is complementary to our desires and our preferences. That is the position of God's word about it.

## Spiritual Assignments and the Divine Initiative

The wrong protocol would be to ask God's Spirit what exactly you must do while ignoring the light you have in God's word. You start out with where you are, the opportunities you have, and your own desires. Then, as you do that, you should confirm by God's Spirit that the direction you are going is right.

This is true of marital relationships as well. If you are living and walking by faith, things will work together for the good of God's purpose for your life. Even where you don't have a specific direction about a relationship, you go by the rule of the word of God, which is you making your choice.

This idea of you making your choice in marriage is found in scripture, such as in Numbers chapter 36 and 1 Corinthians 7:39. It says she may marry whomsoever she wills, only in the Lord. This liberty of her will when it comes to marital decisions is also found when it comes to natural assignments.

When it comes to our spiritual assignment, it begins on the same rule as the natural, which is to start where you are. Those very circumstances in which you are found is where you ought to begin your pursuit of your spiritual assignment. Mark 16:15 says, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature."

The word of God is clear enough for us to begin and take our initiative with. We sometimes lay burdens on ourselves that God does not intend to lay on us. In Acts chapter 16, Paul attempted to take the next step in light of the instruction of the word. He wasn't sitting around waiting; he was ready to go. But then the exception came to him, being forbidden by the Holy Ghost to preach in Asia. That is how we should approach the matter: start from where you are, and exceptions may come to you.
