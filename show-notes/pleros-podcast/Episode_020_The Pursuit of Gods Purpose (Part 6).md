# The Pursuit of God's Purpose (Part 6)

We have previously established several foundational truths. Firstly, the gospel occupies the central place of truth in our lives and in all existence; even those who reject it are still profoundly affected by its reality.

## The Foundation of Sonship and Purpose

Secondly, the gospel provides answers to all fundamental questions of truth. Ultimately, it addresses the deepest question: "Why?" Why does anything exist at all? Why is there created or contingent existence? The answer, as we have seen, lies in God's purpose: sonship.

Sonship, as we have explained, means being God's child and His heir. God's intention is to form a family of children and heirs. As His children, we are called to fellowship with Him and to embody His nature and character. As His heirs, we are entrusted with carrying out the specific assignments He gives us.

We have identified two primary assignments: a natural assignment and a spiritual assignment. While understanding God's purpose is crucial, merely knowing it is insufficient. The natural progression from this understanding is to ask: "How do I fulfill this purpose? What am I actually supposed to do?"

The pursuit of God's purpose is not left to our mere conjecture. While thoughtful consideration might lead us to similar conclusions, God's providence and divine orchestration guide us in navigating this path. His revelation, particularly His written Word—the Scriptures—directly addresses how we are to pursue His purpose.

A central text in this regard is 1 Corinthians 7:17, which states, "Just as God has apportioned to us and as God has called us, that is how we should walk." This refers to the specific conditions in which an individual receives the gospel or comes to understand God's purpose. These are the very conditions God foreknew for that individual to begin their journey in His purpose.

Your new life in Christ does not begin by attempting to rectify your existing conditions. While repentance and abandoning sin are essential, fixing external circumstances or conditions is a different matter. Instead, the instruction is to commence your walk from the state in which you were called.

Verse 20 of 1 Corinthians 7 further emphasizes this: "Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called." This directive concerns your initial circumstances, including marital status. If a person was already married, even to an unbeliever, God is fully aware of that condition when they are called.

## Walking in the State of Your Calling

The instruction is for each person to remain with God in the state in which they were called. It is important to note that exceptions exist, particularly concerning natural assignments, where progress or change might be possible. However, if one seeks to alter fundamental aspects of their identity purely for the sake of faith, it may suggest a carnal approach rather than a spiritual one.

Your external status, in such contexts, holds less significance than your personal desires in Christ. You are to begin your walk with God from the state in which you were called, encompassing the conditions of your natural assignment.

A second principle, alongside starting where you are, is to proactively seize opportunities for greater freedom when they arise. If such an opportunity presents itself, it should be utilized.

The third counsel is found in verse 31, which advises those who use this world to do so without misusing it. This instruction applies to individuals who possess a certain privilege, extending beyond the constraints of circumstances or limitations of opportunity, allowing them to freely choose their path.

## Natural Assignments and the Liberty of Choice

Concerning natural assignments, it is crucial to recognize the liberty of choice we possess—the freedom to choose and act according to our preferences. While every aspect of life is open to the leading of the Spirit, divine guidance in our natural assignments often complements our inherent desires and preferences. This aligns with the teaching of God's Word.

It would be an error to solely seek precise instructions from the Holy Spirit regarding every action while disregarding the clear light provided by God's written Word. Instead, we begin with our current circumstances, the opportunities available to us, and our own desires. As we proceed in this manner, we should then seek confirmation from the Holy Spirit that our chosen direction is aligned with God's will.

This principle also extends to marital relationships. When living and walking by faith, all things will work together for the good of God's purpose in your life. Even in the absence of a specific divine directive concerning a relationship, we operate by the rule of God's Word, which grants us the freedom to make our own choice.

The concept of exercising personal choice in marriage is evident in Scripture, such as in Numbers 36 and 1 Corinthians 7:39, where it states that a woman "may marry whomsoever she wills, only in the Lord." This liberty of will concerning marital decisions mirrors the freedom we have in our natural assignments.

## Spiritual Assignments and the Divine Initiative

Our spiritual assignment begins with the same principle as the natural: start where you are. The very circumstances in which you find yourself are the appropriate starting point for pursuing your spiritual calling. Mark 16:15 instructs us, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature."

God's Word provides sufficient clarity for us to initiate action and take the first steps. We sometimes impose burdens upon ourselves that God never intended. For example, in Acts chapter 16, Paul actively sought to take the next step in fulfilling the Great Commission. He did not passively wait but actively pursued the commission. It was then, and only then, that an exception arose: he was forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach in Asia. This illustrates the proper approach: begin where you are, and divine exceptions or specific directions may follow.
