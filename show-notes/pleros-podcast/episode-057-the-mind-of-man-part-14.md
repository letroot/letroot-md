# The Mind of Man (Part 14)

Welcome back to the Pleros podcast. I trust you're going to be blessed by God's word as you receive your daily dose of His word that transforms you to fulfill God's purpose. We've been looking at the mind of man because we have seen that we exist for God's purpose, which is sonship—to walk as His child as well as His heirs. We've also seen that there's a roadmap involving a daily life of devotion that strengthens us to walk in our nature and character.

## Preparing for the Path of Purpose

Knowing the journey and the path does not necessarily imply that we are prepared to go that path. If you are ill-equipped, you are going to fail, fall on the way, get tired, and eventually get burnt out. If you're going on a journey, you'd better prepare so that you are able to finish it. You could take some extra kegs of fuel if you know there will be no fuel on the way, which is precisely how the Christian journey is.

There is the foundational training, discipleship, and education that we need, and there is yet the continuous training we need over and again to fuel us as we go. That growth happens in our mind because, at salvation, our spirit is entirely changed into that of Christ. We are one spirit with the Lord and possess His very nature and character. Therefore, it is important that we study this reality of the mind so we can walk in what we already possess.

## The Hidden Molding of the Mind

We sometimes underestimate how much our minds were messed up before salvation. Even if you didn't have a big moral flaw, you might downplay how much work your mind needs. Discerning people might see flaws in your character because you have not worked on it, and self may be showing up where dependency on the Spirit ought to be. Different experiences, such as growing up in oppressive or abusive backgrounds, can mold and form the mind in subtle ways.

These contexts affect your worldview and the things you accept as true. For example, people can get so consumed by politics that it becomes everything they talk about, which is especially sad when it happens to preachers. You must guard your heart so that your mind doesn't get consumed by the emotions of the world. We are meant to shine as light in the workplace and in our relationships rather than being subsumed by the mess around us.

## Analyzing the Process of Reasoning

Jesus called us to have an honest self-introspection by checking for the log in our own eye before being concerned with the speck in others. It is more important to identify where you are lagging so you can fix it than to point out the flaws in other people. We really need to check ourselves constantly. Natural information goes through our mind almost all the time, but every time it is communicated, the spiritual persuasion of the source is also being transmitted.

The first thing that happens on our mind when we receive information is reasoning. You don't automatically accept everything; first, you think about it. Beyond reasoning, there is the memory aspect and the conviction aspect—what you agree or disagree with based on what you have heard. Some people have weak reasoning and are gullible, while others arrive at firm conclusions that they can hold onto even when the original reasoning isn't present in their memory.

## The Distinction Between Knowing and Reckoning

In Romans 6, we see that it is possible for people to hold a conviction and yet not see the effect in their daily walk. Paul had to address the Christians in Rome because they already knew the truth, but they were seeing a contradiction in their lives. He reminded them of what they knew and then gave them a specific instruction in verse 11: "Likewise you also reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin but alive to God."

This shows that the point is not a lack of knowledge, but a "reckoning gap." The word reckoning, *logizomai*, means to take account. You can know something without reckoning it, and reckoning is a completely different aspect of the mind. In Romans 12, this is described as renewing or refreshing your mind. You are refreshing what you already know so that you can actually be transformed.

## Transforming Conviction into Consciousness

That you are convinced about something does not mean it has become your consciousness. Before salvation, many people reinforced beliefs about themselves, such as believing they are naturally "angry people." They reinforce this so strongly that it becomes their faith on the matter. Even when they find out they are new creations, that old consciousness may still be stronger than their new conviction.

What we should do is have a "faith stand" with our convictions until they overwhelm our old way of thinking. This part of the mind could be called the consciousness part. In subsequent episodes, we are going to take more time to look at how the mouth speaks from the abundance of the heart. We will study more texts to see how we can properly reckon, present, and affirm ourselves in the truth.
