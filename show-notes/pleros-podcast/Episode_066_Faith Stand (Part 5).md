# Faith Stand (Part 5)

Welcome to Pleros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

Welcome back to the Pleros podcast. This is your daily dose of God's word transforming you to fulfill God's purpose for your life. We are presently looking at the faith stand, which is a very important subject matter built on the back of things we have seen first about God's purpose and the road map of that journey. It takes growth to be able to carry out and fulfill God's purpose for our lives.

You would also recall that we have examined that this growth happens in our mind. When we speak about spiritual growth, it is not something that happens in our spirit because our spirit is in a perfect, complete, and divine state. Spiritual growth is something that happens in our mind. We had some time studying the mind of man where we saw seven aspects, putting special focus on the reckoning or the consciousness part of the human mind.

## From Knowledge to Reckoning

I'm going to begin with Romans chapter 6, which has been how we've been examining this subject matter. In Romans 6, Paul pointed out to his audience that their knowledge in God's word is not enough to make for their walk in the same. He affirmed the knowledge that he shared with them in a rhetorical manner and sometimes outrightly stated it. He says in verse three, "Do you not know as many of us as were baptized into Christ were baptized into his death?" 

Verse 6 as well says, "knowing that our old man has been crucified with him," so he affirmed what they knew. Verse 9 says, "knowing that Christ having been raised from the dead dies no more." It's one thing that we know, but it is another thing entirely that we do something about what we know. By doing something, I'm not talking about trying by our willpower to act on what we know; I'm talking about reckoning ourselves. 

Romans 6:11 says, "Likewise, you reckon yourself to be dead indeed to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord." When we know God's word, the next thing that follows our knowledge is reckoning. We ought to reckon, using that word *logizomai*. James would also use the word in the negative when he used *paralogizomai* in James 1:21. The reason why someone can hear the word but not do it is that the person is reckoning aside himself.

## Defining the Faith Stand

Another word to describe reckoning who we are is the word "to present" used in Romans chapter 6 and verse 13. Paul says that we should present our members as instruments of righteousness and we should not present ourselves as instruments of unrighteousness. That word is also used in Romans 6:19 and Romans 12:1, which has been a major text for us. The word "present" is actually what defined the title "faith stand."

That word "present" is *paristēmi* in the Greek, which is from two words: *para* and *histēmi*. The word *histēmi* simply means to stand, whilst the word *para* means beside. So it means to stand beside. In Romans chapter 12 and in verse one, Paul says, "I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present," which means you stand beside your bodies. 

One of the things I like about that verse is you don't have to do anything to be conformed. Unlike transformation that happens by the renewing of the mind, it is simply said for confirmation that you should not be conformed to the world. It seems to be the default that one could be conformed to the world, but transformation requires effort because of the present reign of sin and death in our world. 

## Transformation and the Proving of God's Will

If we are not intentional about our transformation by the renewing of our mind, then we are not going to see that change in our person that makes us able to do the will of God. When you are transformed, you are able to put to work, or put to the test, what is the good, acceptable, and perfect will of God. The proving here is like when you prove by doing; you are using it to show that it is the case. 

When you are transformed, you are able to do that which is the good, acceptable, and perfect will of God. It's not like there are three wills of God; he is simply using adjectives to describe the single will of God as being good, acceptable, and complete. In that case, doing the entirety of God's will for our life requires this transformation that is by the renewing of our mind. 

We have seen that the renewing of our mind is a repetition of what it means to present ourselves. There is a refreshing of our mind that happens when we present ourselves. Recall that "present" is *paristēmi*, which is to stand beside, and we have examined that this stand is what we call the faith stand. You can see that from 2 Corinthians chapter 1, where it says, "for by faith you stand." 

## The Principle of Heart and Mouth

Our faith in our Christian work is a stand because it's not just one instance of faith like it is at salvation. It is rather an ongoing, deliberate stand of faith that makes for transformation and brings about our walk in God's purpose. In 1 Thessalonians chapter 3, Paul mentions that he was glad they were standing fast in the Lord. Their faith is what he calls their act of standing fast. 

Many of the texts instructing us to stand are about our response of faith to the knowledge of God's word. If we know that faith is how we stand and grow, then it's important to understand the principle of faith. Colossians 2:6 says the way we receive the Lord Jesus is the way we walk in him. We previously spoke about the principle of faith where with the heart a man believes and with the mouth confession is made. 

We see this same principle in Mark 11:23-24. People can mimic faith in expression with their mouth while ignoring the fact that it begins in the heart. There must be conviction before there is that reckoning that makes for our transformation. The Lord said, "whoever says to this mountain be removed... and does not doubt in his heart but believes that the things which he said shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith."

## Growing in the Word

The principle of faith involves the heart and the mouth. This is very common and can be seen in Old Testament texts like Joshua 1:8. "This book of law shall not depart from your mouth; you shall meditate therein day and night." This is also a faith stand. It is not departing from your mouth because you are meditating, which involves your heart. There is an important interaction between our heart and our mouth in faith. 

In understanding how we got saved, we appreciate it better because at salvation it is clear that we believed in our hearts first. You must hear God's word, then it brings a conviction to your heart, and then you speak. At that one instance of speaking for salvific faith, you are saved. But it's going to operate differently when it comes to the faith stand that makes for our work and the renewing of the mind. 

We're going to stop here at this point, but we'll be focusing more on Romans 12:1 from the next episode. I know there's so much to cover, but I trust that you are catching on with what faith stand means and how it affects your growth to fulfill God's purpose. For now, God bless you and see you on the next one. Stay in faith and keep walking in His purpose.
