# The Pursuit of God's Purpose (Part 8)

We are exploring the pursuit of God's purpose, which we have identified as sonship: being His child and His heir. As His child, we are called to walk in fellowship with Him, reflecting His nature and character. As His heir, we are meant to fulfill our assignments, encompassing both our natural and, critically, our spiritual responsibilities. With this foundation, we now focus on the practical steps for pursuing this purpose.

## Pursuing Our Natural Assignment

The guiding principle for pursuing our assignments comes from 1 Corinthians 7:17, where Paul instructs us to walk as God has distributed to each one. This means that regardless of our unique circumstances when we are saved or realize God's will, we are to begin walking with Him from that very point. The essential first step is to "start where you are."

In the previous discussion, we outlined five key actions for pursuing our natural assignment:

1.  **Start where you are:** Utilize your current position and resources.
2.  **Take advantage of opportunities:** Be open to chances that align with your purpose.
3.  **Pursue your own desires:** Align your personal inclinations with God's will.
4.  **Be open to the Spirit's leading:** Remain sensitive to divine guidance.
5.  **Engage with maximum productivity:** Approach your natural assignment with diligence and excellence.

The Lord will assess our engagement in our natural assignments based on the productivity we demonstrate. If we are working for the Lord, deliberate laxity where diligence is required indicates a misalignment. It is imperative to give our best, ensuring we are productive in all we do.

## Awakening the Zeal for Spiritual Assignment

Moving to our spiritual assignment, there is often a significant concern regarding its neglect. This oversight frequently stems from operating in the flesh, where individuals feel weak or unequipped for spiritual duties. We can become so accustomed to our natural assignments that when we recognize our spiritual calling, we may initially feel overwhelmed.

The core strength of our spiritual assignment lies in the burden for souls and the profound realization of why we ourselves received salvation and redemption in Christ Jesus. If salvation and redemption hold true meaning for us, we ought to cultivate a deep zeal and concern for others who need to experience it. This is not about confusing how we fulfill these assignments later, but recognizing the foundational motivation. We have understood what our assignments are; now we are examining the practical steps to take.

## The Universal Rule: Start Where You Are

The rule that applies to our natural assignment—"start where you are"—is equally pertinent to our spiritual assignment. First Corinthians provides a general directive for walking with God, irrespective of our current condition, whether it pertains to marriage, cultural status, or religious identity. These external statuses should not hinder us. Instead, we must focus on our current circumstances, whether circumcised or not, and proceed with God's assignment. Our faith in Christ empowers us to do the work; we should not be sidetracked by questions that undermine the efficacy of Christ's finished work.

How, then, do we begin a spiritual assignment? As established, we start where we are. Mark 16 instructs us simply to "go"; it doesn't stipulate preconditions. Understanding Mark 16, we recognize the call to commence our spiritual assignment precisely from our present location: "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature." While starting where you are, it is also crucial to be open to the leading of the Spirit, which often aligns with God's word. If the Lord directs you to speak on a specific matter, take time to pray and discern His will, much like the apostles in Acts 16.

## Discipleship and the Great Commission

A clearer picture emerges in Matthew 28, where Jesus declared that all authority in heaven and on earth had been given to Him. He then commanded His apostles to "go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to observe all things I have commanded." This instruction to "go therefore" extends to us as the secondary audience of Jesus's words.

Notice the emphasis: "go and make disciples." The path to fulfilling spiritual assignments is through discipling others by teaching them to observe all of Christ’s commands. This process sets them on their course. Discipleship empowers individuals to carry out their spiritual assignment, a truth particularly relevant to the spiritual aspect of our calling.

## Equipping the Saints for Ministry

Ephesians 4 essentially serves as Paul's exposition of the Great Commission. He explains that upon His ascension, Jesus gave gifts to humanity: apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. These leadership roles were given specifically for the "perfecting of the saints." This is the core task Jesus assigned to them.

Luke 6:40 corroborates this, stating that discipleship leads to "perfecting." A disciple, when fully trained, will become like their master. This is precisely the concept conveyed in Ephesians 4:12. Leaders are given for the discipleship of the saints, ultimately equipping them for the "work of ministry." The work of ministry is thus the outcome of leaders successfully perfecting the saints. Our spiritual assignment, the work of ministry, fundamentally requires discipleship and the perfection of the saints. This principle is central to how we initiate and pursue our spiritual assignments.
