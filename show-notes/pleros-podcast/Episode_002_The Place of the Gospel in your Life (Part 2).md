Welcome to the Pleros podcast. You are about to be blessed by the teaching ministry of Pastor Akim. It is going to be an enlightening time in God's word, renewing your mind and transforming your life to fulfill God's purpose. We pray for you that you are established in all the truths of God's word taught today. Let's get right into it.

All right, brothers and sisters, welcome to episode two of the Pleros podcast. We're continuing from where we stopped, looking at the place of the gospel in our lives. We are talking about the different ways people view the gospel, and how sometimes people have a less than appropriate view of it. Some just see it as a one-time event saving them from hell, sin, and death, while others see it merely as a tool to solve problems when they arise.

We have already seen from the last episode that the place of the gospel in our life is the place of truth. According to Ephesians 1:13, the gospel is the word of truth; you trusted after you heard that word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. If the place of the gospel in our lives is that of truth, then it means it is always right. This is the first thing we should recognize: even where we have assumed a particular way about something, if the gospel indeed is truth, then it is right.

## The Five Claims of the Gospel

We must understand the kind of place that the gospel is claiming in our life when it says, "I am the truth." There are five specific things that the gospel claims to be truth, which have serious implications for us. We need to see the gospel prove itself to be the truth, because it is not enough to simply make the claim. We must observe and reason to know if something is true, just as we would use our senses to determine the color of a shirt or the brand of a phone.

The first thing the gospel claims is the reality of God. The second is the reality of redemption fulfilled in Christ Jesus. The third claim is the reality of who we are, or the reality of the new creation—that those who believe in Jesus are now a fundamentally different people by nature. The fourth thing is the reality of God's purpose, providing a clear explanation for why you are here. Lastly, the gospel claims the reality of growth, explaining how we develop to fulfill that purpose.

## Divine Revelation and Human Denial

Let’s look at the first claim: there is a God. If there is a God, we cannot run our lives on our own terms; we have to find out what He made the world for and why the world is the way it is. To see how the gospel proves this claim, we look at Romans 1, starting from verse 16. Paul says he is not ashamed of the gospel of Christ because it is the power of God unto salvation. This is the same gospel of salvation mentioned in Ephesians.

Paul then tells us that in the gospel, both the righteousness of God and the wrath of God are revealed. The righteousness of God is revealed to those who believe, meaning God makes you right and just through the message. However, the wrath of God is revealed to those who suppress the truth. By using this language, Paul equates the gospel with the truth. To suppress the truth means you are in denial of what is obvious, deliberately hardening yourself against reality.

## Evidence Through Observation and Reason

For Paul to claim the gospel is truth, he must provide evidence, and he does so in verse 19. He states that what may be known of God is manifest in them because God has shown it to them. This "manifestation" happens in the mind because the senses can observe what God has displayed. Since the creation of the world, His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made. 

The natural world around us bears witness and leads to the conclusion of the reality of God. Paul highlights that we use our senses for observation ("clearly seen") and our minds for reasoning ("being understood"). Just as you cannot look at a green shirt and honestly claim it is another color, you cannot witness the evidence of the natural world and logically deny the reality of God. The evidence of His eternal power and Godhead is present for all to see.

## The Finite and Contingent World

There are two things people see in the world that lead to the conclusion of God: its finite nature and its contingency. Because the world is finite and had a beginning, it must have a cause that is equal to or greater than itself. When you see an effect like a phone or a book, you automatically recognize it required a cause. Since the natural world is not infinite, we must reason that an entity with equal or greater power brought it forth.

Furthermore, the world is contingent, meaning it is not a "necessary" existence and could have not existed at all. Because we witness a world that contains intelligence, character, and morality, the cause must also possess these traits in equal or greater measure. We are therefore talking about a personal being with supreme intelligence and character. The first thing the gospel shows us is the reality of God, and the evidence of the world gives us no reason to doubt it. Catch you on the next one as we see the other claims.
