Brothers and sisters, today we are continuing our study on the pursuit of God's purpose. Now that we have found out about God's purpose for our lives, we must ask: what do I do now? We have already made major progress by recognizing God's word as the truth that reveals this purpose to us.

## The Reality of Sonship and Fellowship

We have found that God's purpose is sonship; you are His child and you are His heir. As His child, you are called to a life of fellowship with Him and to walk in His nature and character. This walk should be two-fold: it is a devotional walk in fellowship and a practical walk in His nature. One should not hamper the other, as the reality of being His child should flow naturally into the responsibilities of being His heir.

Our walk with God in fellowship must be devotional, meaning there is dedicated time spent with Him, but it should also be infused into our entire day. We find many examples in Scripture, including our Lord waking up early to have that set-aside time as the first thing in the day. From that place of fellowship, you have your day put together by God's Spirit as you set out to pursue your work.

Through the day, you should maintain a heart of fellowship and recognize when you need a break. It should be a matter of commitment to take breaks where you shut out the weight of worldliness and get refreshed by the Father. Historically, the church has always had dedicated times of daily prayer. You can participate in this through the Pleros prayer watch, which offers morning, afternoon, and evening times of prayer via our community channel at pleros.org.

## Spiritual and Natural Assignments

As God's heir, you have both a natural assignment and a spiritual assignment. No doubt, the spiritual assignment is the priority as a matter of eternal value. Even though most people will not commit as much time to their spiritual assignment as their natural one, if your heart does not hold the spiritual as the most valuable, something is wrong with your understanding. Whatever you do in the natural pales in comparison to the value of souls and the lives of people.

What we do in the natural is the Lord's work, but what we do in the spiritual is grave and carries eternal implications. Something must burn in our hearts to see the worth of people who need the light of God's word and the redemption fulfilled in Christ. A central text for this discussion is 1 Corinthians 7:17, which highlights the significance of your person in God's purpose. You are not just another face in the crowd or a freelancer maxing out pleasure; you are a significant part of what God is doing on earth.

## Purpose Gives Value to Pleasure

Pleasure is of God, but it gets its value from purpose. Just as the value of rest comes from work and the value of eating comes from hunger, pleasure was designed by God to complement purpose. You are significant because of the value God has placed on you in creating and redeeming you. He has assigned specific things for you to do, and when you value yourself this way, you can begin living life as it was intended.

## Natural Assignment Phases

In 1 Corinthians 7, we are told to walk in the state in which we were called. Whether you are a slave or free, you are the Lord's freed man and you belong to Him. The earth and its fullness belong to the Lord, so you should take the things you are privileged to do as part of the service you render unto God within creation. While you may start out thinking only of survival, your ultimate role is to serve your part in what God is doing.

We start from where we are, but we also take advantage of opportunities. As verse 21 says, if you can be made free, you should use that opportunity. This shows that while we start with our present constraints and limitations, it is part of the wisdom of God’s word to recognize and take advantage of the opportunities available to us. This is a direct revelation: you should use the opportunities that open up as you carry out your natural assignments.

Finally, 1 Corinthians 7:29-31 shows us a third phase where we use this world without misusing it. This points to a stage where you can pursue your own desires in the world, but not for selfish reasons or self-absorption. There are three phases to the natural assignment: starting where you are, taking opportunities that come to you, and using your own accord relative to the world. In the next episode, we will look at our spiritual assignment and how we pursue it as well.
