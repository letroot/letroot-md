# Level Up Your Life In 2026 | Shaan Puri

## Summary
In this special role-reversal episode, Shaan Puri is interviewed by his former intern, [[Walter]], who now runs his own podcast. Shaan reflects on his early 20s, sharing the pivotal decisions that shaped his career before his major exits. He discusses the concept of being "strategically broke" to prioritize learning and freedom, the power of proximity in accelerating growth, and how to overcome the inertia that keeps high-potential people stuck in mediocre paths.

## Key Insights
*   **[[Strategically Broke]]**: Shaan's framework for his early 20s. Instead of optimizing for a high salary (being "money rich, time poor"), he optimized for freedom, learning, and adventure. He calculated his [[Minimum Viable Income]] (~$8k/year) to survive and spent the rest of his energy acquiring skills and experiences.
*   **[[Proximity Is Power]]**: You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. Shaan used this principle to accelerate his growth by moving to [[San Francisco]] despite having no job, simply because that's where serious founders were. It's easier to be "pulled" into success by your environment than to "push" yourself with willpower.
*   **[[The Inertia Trap]]**: Physics dictates that an object in motion stays in motion. In careers, this manifests as continuing a project or job simply because you're already doing it. Shaan uses the **"Suli Test"**: "If this company closed today, would I call these same people tomorrow to start this exact same business?" If the answer is no, you are operating on inertia, not conviction.
*   **[[Rule of 100]]**: A principle from [[MrBeast]] ([[Jimmy Donaldson]]). Before asking for advice or judging your success, make 100 videos (or iterations of your craft), improving one specific thing each time. Most people are not serious enough to do the boring volume required to get good.
*   **[[Motion vs Direction]]**: When you don't know where to go (like being lost in fog), it's better to start paddling (motion) than to stand still waiting for clarity (direction). Momentum often reveals the path, and it's easier to steer a moving ship than a stationary one.
*   **[[Two-Way Doors]]**: Most decisions are reversible. Shaan credits his success not to making perfect decisions, but to making "great reversals"—quickly cutting losses on relationships, jobs, or businesses once he realizes they aren't right.

## Coach's Corner
Daniel, this episode is a masterclass on the "Founder Mindset" you're building.
*   **The "Suli Test" for SaaS**: You're building your first product. Ask yourself regularly: "If I hadn't written a line of code for this yet, would I start *this* specific idea today based on what I now know?" If no, pivot immediately. Don't fall for the [[Sunk Cost Fallacy]].
*   **Volume leads to Quality**: Like the [[Rule of 100]], your first version of the SaaS (or your first few cold emails) won't be perfect. Commit to shipping 100 small updates or doing 100 customer reach-outs.
*   **Environment**: You're in [[Africa/Lagos]]. Ensure your digital proximity (Twitter, Discords, this workspace) surrounds you with other "serious" builders to keep your standards high.

## Action Items
*   [ ] **Audit your Inertia**: Apply the [[Suli Test]] to your current feature set or marketing channel. Are you doing it just because you started it?
*   [ ] **Define your "Strategically Broke" Number**: Calculate exactly how much runway you have and what your monthly "survival" cost is. This gives you the freedom to take big swings without fear.
*   [ ] **Commit to the Rule of 100**: For your next marketing effort (e.g., content or outreach), commit to 100 reps before assessing if the channel works.
