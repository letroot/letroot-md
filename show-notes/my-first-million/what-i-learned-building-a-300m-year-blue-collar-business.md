# What I Learned Building a $300M/Year Blue-Collar Business

## Summary
Tommy Mello shares the frameworks he used to scale his home service business (A1 Garage Door Service) to $300M/year. The conversation centers on radical systemization, hiring to delegate weaknesses, and a structured approach to personal goal setting across six key life areas.

## Key Insights
*   **[[Reverse Engineer]] Goals**: Start with the end in mind and work backward to determine the daily actions needed.
*   **Delegate Your Weaknesses**: Circle the tasks on your org chart that you hate doing, and hire specifically for those roles first.
*   **The [[Iron Triangle]]**: You can only pick two: Best Timing (Fast), Best Quality (Good), or Cheapest (Cheap).
*   **Master [[Influence]]**: Study [[Cialdini]]'s principles of persuasion. Sales and marketing are non-negotiable skills for a founder.
*   **Radical [[Systemization]]**: Systems are the only way to save time and scale. If it's not documented, it's not scalable.
*   **The [[6 F's Framework]]**: Balance personal development across:
    *   **Family & Friends**
    *   **Faith**
    *   **Fitness**
    *   **Finance**
    *   **Future Self**
    *   **Fun**
*   **[[Accountability]]**:
    *   Place written goals in 4 visible spots (shower, car, fridge, desk).
    *   Get accountability partners for each specific goal.
    *   Publicly declare goals on social media to enforce commitment.

## Coach's Corner
You're a developer, so you understand logic. Apply that to your *life* and *business operations*.
1.  **Systemize Your Operations.** Just as you wouldn't deploy code without CI/CD, don't run your business without documented SOPs.
2.  **Hire Your Anti-Self.** Stop trying to be the "marketing guy" if you hate it. Hire for that role so you can focus on product/engineering where you excel.
3.  **Visible Goals.** Don't hide your targets in a Notion page you never open. Put them where you can't ignore them.

## Action Items
*   [ ] **Create Your "6 F's" Plan**: Define one clear goal for Family, Faith, Fitness, Finance, Future Self, and Fun.
*   [ ] **Post Your Goals Visibly**: Write them down and stick them on your monitor or bathroom mirror.
*   [ ] **Audit Your Org Chart**: Identify the one role you despise the most and draft a plan to hire for it (or automate it).
*   [ ] **Find Accountability Partners**: Set up a weekly check-in with someone for your most critical business goal.
