# 3 mindset shifts from billionaires (you won't find in books/videos)

## Summary
Shaan Puri shares three key lessons from a recent "Billionaire Basketball Camp" event he attended with high-net-worth founders (including owners of NBA teams and unicorn startups). The insights center on the intensity required at the highest levels, how culture must be demonstrated through extreme actions (not just words), and the necessity of reinvention ("you can't top pigs with pigs") to avoid stagnation.

## Key Insights
*   **Intensity is the Strategy**: Successful founders (like [[Matt Ishbia]]) don't just delegate; they obsess over details. Ishbia walks the floor daily to find three problems to fix. 3 problems/day * 365 days = 1,000 bottlenecks removed per year. That's how you grow a massive company.
    *   *Note:* It's not about being a "visionary" in the clouds; it's about executing maniacally on the ground.
*   **Culture is an Action Word**: [[Jesse Cole]] ([[Savannah Bananas]]) doesn't just *say* "put on a show." He demonstrates it. For player orientation, he hired a police escort, fireworks, and had staff cheer as players arrived—before a single fan saw anything. This sets the bar: "This is how we treat people. Now go treat the fans this way."
    *   *Lesson:* You can't ask employees to care if you don't show them what caring looks like first.
*   **You Can't Top Pigs with Pigs**: A [[Walt Disney]] quote. After "Three Little Pigs" was a hit, distributors wanted "More Pigs." Walt refused, knowing you can't just repeat a success to top it; you must reinvent.
    *   *Application:* [[Joe Gebbia]] (Airbnb) left to reinvent himself as a designer for government services (transforming dull experiences like retirement paperwork). Don't just do "Startup 2.0" in the same niche; find a new mountain.
*   **Lifestyle vs. Life**: Be careful envying the *result* (the "life" of having a billion dollars) without wanting the *process* (the "lifestyle" of 24/7 stress, 4 assistants, constant travel). If you don't want the lifestyle, don't chase the life.

## Coach's Corner
For your new SaaS journey:
1.  **Intensity**: You can't delegate the product vision yet. Like Ishbia, walk the "digital floor" daily—fix 3 small UX issues, reply to 3 support tickets yourself. The founder sets the pace.
2.  **Culture**: Even if you're a team of one or two, define your culture now by your actions. How you treat your first beta users sets the tone for your future customer success team. Over-deliver (send a personal video, not an automated email).
3.  **Reinvention**: You're reinventing yourself from "builder" to "founder." Don't just code more features ("pigs with pigs"); learn the sales and marketing skills that feel uncomfortable. That's the reinvention required to succeed.

## Action Items
*   [ ] **The 3 Daily Fixes**: Start tracking 3 small "bottlenecks" or bugs you fix in your dev process every day.
*   [ ] **Audit your "Culture Actions"**: How do you onboard new clients or collaborators? Is it a "wow" experience that sets the tone, or just an email?
*   [ ] **Reflect on "Lifestyle vs Life"**: Do you actually want the agency owner lifestyle (managing people, sales), or do you just want the *result* (money)? Adjust your role accordingly.
