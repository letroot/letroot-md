# How To Make $1M So Fast, Your Accountant Gets Nervous

## Summary
Tyler Denk (Founder/CEO of beehiiv) breaks down how he grew the platform from zero to $30M ARR in four years using a "brick by brick" strategy. He shares his playbook on founder-market fit, doing unscalable things early on, and using product velocity as a marketing narrative.

## Key Insights
*   **[[Founder-Market Fit]] (The "[[Killshot]]")**: [[Tyler Denk]] leveraged his background at [[Morning Brew]] to establish instant credibility. His "killshot" story: "I ran growth for the fastest-growing newsletter in the world, and now I’m building those same tools for you."
*   **Customer Research via DMs**: Instead of traditional surveys, Tyler DMed hundreds of newsletter operators on [[Twitter]] to uncover specific [[Pain Points]] (e.g., revenue cuts, lack of referral tools) which became his marketing hooks.
*   **[[Do Things That Don't Scale]]**: Manually approving users allowed for personal DMs and high-touch onboarding, turning early adopters into "fanatics."
*   **[[Product Velocity]] as Narrative**: Shipping one marketable feature *every week* created a sense of unstoppable momentum. This convinced users to stick around even if a feature they needed wasn't built yet—because they trusted it *would* be soon.
*   **[[Building in Public]]**: Transparent updates (good and bad) build an audience beyond just customers, creating a "FOMO flywheel" for investors and talent.
*   **Simplicity > Scalability**: Simple pricing ($99/unlimited) beat complex, scalable models because it could be communicated in a single tweet.
*   **Inherent [[Virality]]**: The "Powered by beehiiv" badge acts as a billboard on millions of emails, driving organic growth.

## Coach's Corner
You're building a SaaS. Stop overthinking the perfect automated funnel.
1.  **Do the manual work.** DM your first 100 users. Onboard them personally. That feedback loop is your lifeblood right now.
2.  **Ship weekly.** It doesn't have to be massive, but it has to be *visible*. Train your market to expect progress from you constantly.
3.  **Simplify your pitch.** If you can't explain your value prop (and pricing) in one tweet, it's too complicated.

## Action Items
*   [ ] **Craft your "Killshot"**: Write down the one sentence that proves you are *the* person to solve this problem. Use it in every intro.
*   [ ] **Ask the "Magic" Discovery Question**: In user calls, ask: "What specific pain made you book this demo?" or "What would make this a huge win for you?"
*   [ ] **Prioritize by the "Tweet Test"**: Before building a feature, write the launch tweet. If the tweet isn't exciting, the feature might not be worth building yet.
*   [ ] **Implement "Pet the Dog"**: reach out to 5 potential or current users today just to engage, not to sell.
