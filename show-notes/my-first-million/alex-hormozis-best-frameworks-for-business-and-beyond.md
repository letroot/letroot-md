# Alex Hormozi's best frameworks for business and beyond

## Summary
Alex Hormozi joins Sam Parr to discuss high-leverage frameworks for hiring, management, and personal growth. They explore the "Management Diamond" for diagnosing employee performance issues, the concept of hiring for "rate of learning" (general intelligence) over experience, and the transition from operator to "collector of people" as a company scales past $5M revenue. Alex also shares personal reflections on his mother's passing, the emptiness of achieving big financial goals, and his shift toward valuing character and service over pure achievement.

## Key Insights
*   **Talent as Capital**: [[Talent]] offers the highest returns on capital (10x-100x). As you scale (past ~$5M revenue), your role shifts from "doing" to becoming a "collector of people."
*   **The Management Diamond**: A framework for diagnosing why an employee isn't performing:
    1.  **Don't know what to do** (Communication issue)
    2.  **Don't know how to do it** (Training issue)
    3.  **Don't know when to do it** (Deadline/Priority issue)
    4.  **Something blocking them** (Resource issue)
    *   *Note:* "Motivation" is rarely the primary issue; check the other four first.
*   **Hiring for Intelligence vs. Experience**: Alex prioritizes **General Intelligence** (defined as "rate of learning") over specific experience. A smart person can bridge the skill gap quickly, whereas a rigid experienced person might not adapt.
*   **Clouds to Dirt**: The best leaders have "full stack" skills—they can operate at the strategic level ("clouds") and execute at the tactical level ("dirt").
*   **Local vs. Global Good**: When firing someone, frame it as avoiding "local good" (sparing one person's feelings) for "global bad" (harming the team/company). You owe it to the high performers to remove the drag.
*   **Patience vs. Speed**: Patience applies to the *outcome* (the macro goal), but speed applies to the *actions* (the micro steps). "Macro patience, micro speed."
*   **Pain is the Pitch**: In marketing/copywriting, describing the customer's pain in excruciating detail is more effective than promising a solution. If you can articulate their pain better than they can, they assume you have the solution. [[Pain vs Promise]]

## Coach's Corner
As a new SaaS founder, the shift from "coder" to "collector of people" is your biggest hurdle. You're used to fixing bugs yourself (the "dirt"); now you must design the system (the "clouds"). Use the [[Management Diamond]] to debug your early hires or contractors—don't assume they're lazy; assume you didn't explain the "what" or "how." Also, apply "pain is the pitch" to your landing page: stop selling your features (React/Tailwind stack) and start selling the expensive problem your SaaS solves.

## Action Items
*   [ ] **Diagnose performance issues**: Use the [[Management Diamond]] next time a collaborator or tool isn't delivering. Is it a *what*, *how*, *when*, or *blocker* issue?
*   [ ] **Refine your "Pain Pitch"**: Review your landing page copy. Are you describing the *pain* of the user's problem vividly enough?
*   [ ] **Audit your time**: Are you "collecting people" (building a network/team) or just doing tasks? If you want to scale, shift focus to finding talent.

## Resources
*   [Founders Podcast](https://www.founderspodcast.com/) - Mentioned by Sam as a source of lessons on patience.
*   [[David Ogilvy]] / [[Claude Hopkins]] - Recommended for "old school" direct response copywriting.
*   [[Felix Dennis]] - *How to Get Rich* (highly recommended by Alex for writing style).
