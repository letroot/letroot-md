# Every Level of Business ($10k, $100k, $1m, $10m, $100m) w/ Sam Parr (on Grant Owen)

## Summary
Sam Parr breaks down the skills and focus required at different revenue milestones. He emphasizes copywriting as the single most critical skill, details a specific framework for effective cold outreach, and discusses the mindset shift needed to scale past the early stages.

## Key Insights
*   **[[Copywriting]] is King**: The ability to transfer an idea from your head into someone else's head is the most valuable skill in business.
*   **The [[Cold Email]] Framework ([[AIDA]])**:
    *   **[[Attention]]**: Cut through the noise immediately. "I know no one reads this old blog post of yours, but I did..."
    *   **[[Interest]]**: Prove you've done the work. Reference specific, obscure details to show genuine effort.
    *   **[[Desire]]**: Make them want what you have.
    *   **[[Action]]**: Give a clear, low-friction next step. "Reply if interested, tell me to f**k off if not."
*   **The Grind Phase ($0 - $1-3M)**: Put your head down, ignore distractions, and execute. Don't look up until you've hit [[Escape Velocity]].
*   **[[Distribution]] at Scale**: To hit $100k/month, you need a reliable distribution channel—whether paid ads or a dialed-in cold email engine.
*   **Manifestation via Belief**: You manifest what you truly believe is possible.
*   **Peer Group**: You *must* surround yourself with people building at your level or slightly ahead. Isolation kills momentum.

## Coach's Corner
Stop trying to automate everything before you've even validated the manual process.
1.  **Learn Copywriting.** Seriously. Read the books listed below. Your landing page, your emails, your investor updates—it's all copy.
2.  **Send Cold Emails.** Use the specific template Sam outlined. Personalize heavily. Don't spam; sniper-target your early users/partners.
3.  **Head Down.** If you're under $1M ARR, stop worrying about "strategy" and start worrying about "execution."

## Action Items
*   [ ] **Master Copywriting**: Read *Ogilvy on Advertising* and *The Adweek Copywriting Handbook*.
*   [ ] **Launch a Cold Email Campaign**: Write 10 highly personalized cold emails using the AIDA framework to potential high-value users or partners.
