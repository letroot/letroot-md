# We had to talk about this Elon interview

## Summary
The hosts react to a viral Elon Musk interview, extracting his core operating principles at SpaceX. Key themes include his unique hiring heuristics, his intense focus on speed, and the "limiting factor" philosophy for overcoming bottlenecks.

## Key Insights
*   **Hiring Philosophy ("[[Exceptional Ability]]")**: Resume credentials matter less than raw proof of capability. Elon personally interviewed the first 1,000 [[SpaceX]] employees to filter for "evidence of exceptional ability."
*   **Maniacal Sense of [[Urgency]]**: Set deadlines that have only a 50% probability of success. Why? Because work expands to fill the time available ([[Parkinson's Law]]). If you give it a month, it takes a month. If you give it a week, you might fail, but you'll learn faster.
*   **The [[Limiting Factor]]**: Identify the single biggest bottleneck preventing progress. Once identified, ignore everything else and "go apeshit" on fixing that one thing.
*   **Accepting Trade-offs**: To move fast on the limiting factor, you must explicitly accept that other areas will suffer or break. You can't optimize everything at once.

## Coach's Corner
As a solo founder/dev, you are the bottleneck.
1.  **Stop optimizing the wrong thing.** Are you refactoring code that works just fine instead of fixing your onboarding flow where 90% of users drop off? Find the *actual* limiting factor.
2.  **Set impossible deadlines.** Give yourself 2 hours to ship a feature that "should" take 2 days. The constraints force creativity and prevent over-engineering.
3.  **Hire for proof, not pedigree.** When you're ready to hire, look for GitHub repos and shipped projects, not degrees.

## Action Items
*   [ ] **Identify Your Limiting Factor**: What is the ONE thing stopping you from doubling your MRR right now? Write it down.
*   [ ] **Set a "50% Success" Deadline**: Pick a feature or task for this week and cut the timeline in half. Commit to shipping it by then.
*   [ ] **Audit Your Time**: Are you doing work that isn't attacking the limiting factor? Stop doing it.
