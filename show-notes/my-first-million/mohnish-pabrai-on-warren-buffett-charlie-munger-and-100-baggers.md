# Mohnish Pabrai on Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, and 100 Baggers

## Summary
Mohnish Pabrai, a renowned value investor often called the "Indian Warren Buffett," joins Shaan Puri to discuss his journey from IT entrepreneur to managing hundreds of millions in assets. He shares deep insights from his close friendships with [[Warren Buffett]] and [[Charlie Munger]], explaining how they use the same brain cells for business and investing. The conversation covers the power of compounding, the "Dhandho" framework (low risk, high uncertainty), and why the best investors are often those who can "watch paint dry."

## Key Insights
*   **Entrepreneurs vs. Investors**: They use the same part of the brain. Warren Buffett is a better investor because he's a businessman, and a better businessman because he's an investor.
    *   *Lemonade Stand Test*: When evaluating CEOs, Mohnish looks for early entrepreneurial traits (e.g., did they run a lemonade stand at 12?).
*   **The 10-Year Specialization Window**: The human brain has a critical window between ages 11-20 to specialize. Buffett specialized in business during this time (pinball machines, horse racing tips), while Bill Gates specialized in coding.
*   **Heads I Win, Tails I Don't Lose Much**: The core "Dhandho" philosophy. Entrepreneurs don't take risks; they minimize them.
    *   *Example*: Buffett's pinball business cost $15. Worst case? $3 loss. Best case? Infinite returns.
    *   *Example*: Mohnish starting his IT business with his 401k while keeping his day job until revenue replaced his salary.
*   **Compounding & Rule of 72**: The most important thing in life is how long it takes money to double (72 / interest rate).
    *   *The Variables*: 1. Starting capital. 2. Rate of return. 3. Length of runway.
    *   *Buffett's Edge*: His runway is 80+ years.
*   **Circle the Wagons**: Buffett made ~400 investment decisions in 58 years, but only **12** moved the needle. The key wasn't just buying them, but **never selling** (inactivity).
    *   *Quote*: "The key to moving the needle is inactivity."
*   **Harsh Grader of People**: A lesson from Buffett—classify people into three buckets:
    1.  **Exceptional** (Inner circle)
    2.  **Toxic/Useless** (Avoid)
    3.  **The Unknown 92%** (Treat them like the useless pile until proven otherwise).
    *   *Why*: The cost of missing a good person is low (infinite supply of humans), but the cost of letting a bad person in is high.
*   **Hated and Unloved**: Mohnish looks for opportunities in industries everyone hates (e.g., coal, funeral homes, Turkish stocks). Mispricing happens when emotion (hatred) overrides math.

## Coach's Corner
As a SaaS founder, you are in the "11-20" specialization phase of your new career path.
*   **Risk Mitigation**: Like Mohnish keeping his job while starting his IT firm, don't bet the farm. Find ways to test your SaaS features with "pinball machine" risk (low cost, high upside).
*   **Inactivity**: Once you find a marketing channel or feature that works (your "12 decisions"), don't get bored and change it. Double down and let it compound.
*   **Lemonade Stand**: You're building your track record now. The "lemonade stand" stories you create today (how you handled a crash, how you got your first 10 users) will define your credibility later.

## Action Items
*   [ ] **Apply the "Rule of 72" to your metrics**: If you grow users 10% month-over-month, you double every 7.2 months. Is that fast enough?
*   [ ] **Audit your "Inner Circle"**: Apply the "Harsh Grader" test. Are you spending time with "givers" (Adam Grant's definition) or "takers"?
*   [ ] **Identify "Hated" Opportunities**: Is there a marketing channel or customer segment your competitors ignore because it's "uncool" or "boring"? Go there.
