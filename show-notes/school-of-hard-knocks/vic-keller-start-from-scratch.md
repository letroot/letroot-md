# If I Had to Start From Scratch Again, I’d Do This | Vic Keller

## Summary
The School of Hard Knocks team sits down with [[Vic Keller]], a "business mogul" who has founded 17 companies and exited 9 of them (including 3 to [[Berkshire Hathaway]]). Vic shares his journey from flipping burgers to partnering with billionaires in his 20s. He breaks down the difference between a "boring business" and a "durable business," his strict framework for hiring talent (the 3 C's), and why "professionalization" is the key to breaking through the $5M revenue ceiling.

## Key Insights
*   **[[Durable Business]]**: Vic argues that the goal isn't just a "boring business" or an "AI business," but a *durable* one. A durable business is depression-proof, not just recession-proof. It relies on systems that function without the founder.
    *   **The Pilot Analogy**: When flying in a storm, your senses will lie to you. You must trust your **gauges** (systems and data). In business, when things get emotional or chaotic, you must trust your processes, not your gut feelings.
*   **[[The 3 C's of Hiring]]**: A framework Vic adopted from [[Chick-fil-A]] and confirmed by a [[Delta Force]] operator.
    1.  **Character**: Integrity above all.
    2.  **Competency**: Not just intelligence, but *curiosity* and the ability to learn.
    3.  **Chemistry**: Can we work together? No "brilliant jerks." Even a unicorn employee isn't worth it if they destroy team chemistry.
*   **[[Professionalization]]**: The bottleneck that keeps companies stuck at $2M-$5M revenue is a lack of professionalization. To scale to $10M+, you must "act bigger than you are." This means building systems that attract not just customers, but **top-tier talent**. Top talent won't work for an unprofessional, chaotic shop.
*   **[[Power of Partnership]]**: Vic shifted his mindset from **Exclusivity** (I want to own 100% of a grape) to **Inclusivity** (I'd rather own a piece of a watermelon).
    *   **Story**: At 24, he couldn't sell his product to individual car dealerships. Instead of grinding door-to-door, he researched who *owned* the dealerships, cold-called the billionaire owner, and turned a sales pitch into a life-changing partnership.
*   **[[Loyalty through Mistakes]]**: Vic shares a story where an employee accidentally shipped flammable chemicals on a passenger plane, bringing the [[FAA]] to his door. Instead of firing the employee, Vic told him, "We just spent a fortune on your education; you're not going anywhere." That loyalty created a lifelong employee.

## Coach's Corner
Daniel, Vic's approach is the "scale-up" playbook you'll need once you have product-market fit.
*   **Durability over Hype**: As you build your SaaS, don't chase the AI trend just for the sake of it. Ask: "If the internet hype cycle dies tomorrow, does my product still solve a critical pain point?"
*   **The "Pilot" Mindset**: You are currently flying by VFR (Visual Flight Rules)—trusting your gut and coding what feels right. To scale, you need IFR (Instrument Flight Rules)—metrics, automated tests, and documented processes.
*   **Partnerships**: Vic's hack of "finding the guy who owns the dealerships" is a great lesson for B2B sales. Don't sell to the user if you can partner with the platform/owner who controls 1,000 users.

## Action Items
*   [ ] **Define Your 3 C's**: Even if you're just hiring contractors or co-founders, write down what "Character, Competency, and Chemistry" means for your startup.
*   [ ] **Audit Your "Gauges"**: What are the 3-5 metrics you look at to know if your business is flying straight? (e.g., Daily Active Users, Churn, ARR). If you don't have a dashboard, build one.
*   [ ] **Professionalize Early**: Look at your public-facing presence (website, docs, email signature). Does it look like a $10M company or a side project? "Act bigger" to attract bigger opportunities.
