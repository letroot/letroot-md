																											# Visualizations Progress Report

## Overview

This document summarizes the work completed so far on the interactive digital visualizations for the Borders project. Five poems with translations now have custom animations that interpret the project's central themes of migration, border-crossing, language fluidity, and identity.

## The Visualisations

### 1. "Give Me English" by Ai Jiang (English ↔ Chinese)

**Concept: Erasure and Displacement**

The visualization begins with Chinese text fully visible. Over time, individual characters begin to fade and disappear—eroded away like something being forgotten or suppressed. As this erasure progresses, English words start to appear scattered throughout the space, emerging where Chinese once stood.

When the English text is fully revealed, its letters detach and fall like ash or snow, drifting down and out of view. Then the Chinese characters slowly return, and the cycle begins again.

This captures something the poem itself wrestles with: the pressure to adopt a dominant language, the feeling of one's native tongue being displaced, and yet—its persistence. The languages don't coexist peacefully here; they're in a kind of struggle, each taking turns occupying the same space.

### 2. "The Norms From Up Here" by Renan Bernado (English ↔ Brazilian Portuguese)

**Concept: Ants Revealing Text**

Two panels sit side by side—English on the left, Portuguese on the right. The text isn't immediately visible. Instead, simulated "ants" crawl across each canvas, and wherever they walk, they reveal the letters underneath.

The ants wander somewhat randomly, turning and meandering, gradually uncovering the full poem through their accumulated paths. Once everything is revealed, the canvas resets and the ants begin again.

This approach treats language not as something simply *given*, but as something that must be *discovered* or *excavated*. The ants themselves evoke labor, collective effort, and the slow construction of meaning—relevant to themes of migration and the work of adapting to new environments.

### 3. "Portrait of a Poem as Etymology" by Abdullah Jimoh (English ↔ Yoruba)

**Concept: Melting and Reforming**

The text appears stable at first. Then, line by line, it begins to "melt"—the letters appear to liquefy and pool at the bottom of each line. From these pools, new text rises and solidifies: the same poem, now in Yoruba. After a pause, the Yoruba melts and English re-emerges.

This visual metaphor treats translation not as substitution but as transformation. One language dissolves into something formless, then reconstitutes as another. It suggests that beneath the surface of different languages, there's a shared substance—meaning itself—that can take different shapes.

### 4. "My Country Is A Ghost" by Eugenia Triantafyllou (English ↔ Greek)

**Concept: The Scanner Pass**

A thin horizontal line—glowing faintly green—moves slowly down the page. As it passes over each line of text, the English transforms into Greek. When it reaches the bottom, it holds briefly, then sweeps back up, converting Greek back to English.

The scanner aesthetic evokes border checkpoints, document verification, and the surveillance apparatus that migrants encounter. But it's also a kind of translation machine, converting one language into another through its passage. The slow, methodical sweep gives viewers time to read both versions.

### 5. "Misidentity" by Eugen Bacon (English ↔ Swahili ↔ Dutch)

**Concept: Strip Flipping**

The poem is divided into vertical strips that cover the entire display area. These strips flip like the split-flap displays found at train stations and airports—the mechanical boards that click through letters to announce arrivals and departures.

The strips flip asynchronously, each rotating to reveal the same poem in a different language on its back. This piece cycles through three languages: English, Swahili, and Dutch.

The airport-board aesthetic connects to themes of transit, departure, and the administrative systems that process travelers. The staggered flipping creates moments where languages are mixed mid-transition—words in different languages visible simultaneously, briefly illegible, then resolving into coherence.

## How These Connect to the Project Vision

The Borders project aims to create "a dynamic, multilingual digital story-form that explores themes of migration, identity, and language." Each visualization interprets these themes through a different lens:

- **Displacement and return** (Give Me English): Languages don't just coexist; they compete for space.

- **Discovery through labor** (Norms From Up Here): Meaning isn't given freely; it must be uncovered.

- **Transformation and fluidity** (Portrait as Etymology): Languages are different shapes of the same substance.

- **Institutional processing** (My Country Is A Ghost): Translation as a scanning, converting, bureaucratic act.

- **Transit and liminality** (Misidentity): The in-between states where identity is being reassembled.

The project description speaks of borders that "blur and disappear, allowing languages to flow freely into one another." These visualizations explore *how* that blurring happens—whether through erosion, discovery, melting, scanning, or mechanical transformation.

## The Skeleton and the Skin

What we have now is a **structural skeleton**: the core animation concepts are functional and interpret the themes effectively. Each visualization runs smoothly, responds to different screen sizes, and cycles continuously.

But these are deliberately minimal in their visual presentation—monochrome text on dark backgrounds, simple geometric forms, no imagery beyond the letters themselves.

This is intentional. The animations are designed as **systems that can receive aesthetic layers**. Think of them as the underlying movement and timing, ready to be dressed in visual style.

### Potential Aesthetic Additions

Here are some directions the aesthetic phase could take:

**Photography or Video Backgrounds**

- Images of coastlines, borders, airports, documents

- Textures: paper, water, concrete, fabric

- The animations could interact with these backgrounds—text revealing what's beneath, or backgrounds shifting with the language transitions

**Painterly or Illustrated Elements**

- Hand-drawn textures overlaid on the digital animations

- Watercolor effects for the "melting" visualization

- Ink or brushwork aesthetics for Chinese/Yoruba scripts

**Color Palettes**

- Currently grayscale; could introduce color tied to each language or each poem's emotional register

- Subtle gradients, earth tones, or high-contrast palettes depending on tone

**Typography Variations**

- Different typefaces for different languages (while maintaining readability)

- Weight and size variations to emphasize certain words or phrases

**Environmental Audio** (if the gallery context allows)

- Ambient sounds, spoken word, or musical elements synced to transitions

## Open for Collaboration

The aesthetic phase is where we'd benefit most from input. The animations are ready to support whatever visual direction feels right for the exhibition context and the overall artistic vision.

Questions worth considering:

- Should each poem have a distinct visual identity, or should there be a unified aesthetic across all pieces?

- Are there specific images, textures, or color associations that feel important?

- How much visual "noise" is appropriate? Should the focus remain primarily on the text, or can imagery compete for attention?

- What's the physical context? Projections, screens, interactive kiosks? This affects scale and detail decisions.

**Suggestions are welcome.** The current implementations are built to be modified—adding backgrounds, adjusting colors, or layering new visual elements won't require rebuilding the core animation logic.

## Summary

Five poems now have working visualizations:

| Poem | Languages | Animation Concept |

|------|-----------|-------------------|

| Give Me English | EN ↔ Chinese | Erasure and particle fall |

| The Norms From Up Here | EN ↔ Portuguese | Ant-path text revelation |

| Portrait of a Poem as Etymology | EN ↔ Yoruba | Melting and reforming |

| My Country Is A Ghost | EN ↔ Greek | Scanner line transformation |

| Misidentity | EN ↔ Swahili ↔ Dutch | Split-flap strip flipping |

The animations work and interpret the project's themes. Now they're ready to be painted.
